SUMMARY:EoCoE School 2022
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1487
DESCRIPTION:<p>EoCoE School offers collaborative online learning 
 opportunities on Energy-oriented Centre of Excellence project tools and 
 codes. In its mission to accelerate the transition to the production\, 
 storage and management of clean\, decarbonized energy\, EoCoE channels its
  efforts into 5 scientific Exascale challenges in the low-carbon sectors 
 of Energy Meteorology\, Materials\, Water\, Wind and Fusion. A world-class
  consortium of 18 complementary partners from 7 countries form a unique 
 network of expertise in energy science\, scientific computing and HPC\, 
 including 3 leading European supercomputing centres.</p> <p>Participants 
 will be taught for free and supported online by experts in High 
 Performance Computing and in Sustainable Energies. This event creates a 
 great opportunity to share experience and learn more about EoCoE technical
  and industrial work. During the hand-on sessions attendees will be using 
 the EoCoE SaaS Portal that benefits from the Altair supercomputer (Top 
 500). At the end of the event each participant will be awarded with 
 certification.<br> Target audience are scientists and researchers from
