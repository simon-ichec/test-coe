SUMMARY:BioExcel Summer School on Biomolecular Simulations 2022
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1316
DESCRIPTION:<p>The summer school will include lectures and hands-on 
 sessions on the following topics:</p> <ul> <li>Molecular dynamics 
 simulations</li> <li>Biomolecular docking</li> <li>Free energy 
 calculations</li> <li>Advanced sampling methods (Metadynamics)</li> 
 <li>BioExcel Building Blocks (BioBB)</li> <li>Quantum mechanics/molecular 
 mechanics (QM/MM)</li> <li>Machine learning</li> </ul> <p>During the 
 hands-on computer practicals you will make use of the BioExcel flagship 
 software and tools: e.g. GROMACS\, HADDOCK\, PMX\, BioBB\, and CP2K. The 
 trainers\, developers and/or experts in the use of the software\, will 
 provide guidance and support.</p> <p><strong>Audience and 
 Prerequisites</strong></p> <p>The BioExcel school is intended for 
 primarily PhD and post-doctoral researchers using or planning to use 
 biomolecular modeling and simulation in their everyday research. 
 Familiarity with Linux and basic knowledge of molecular modelling software
  is a requirement.</p>

SUMMARY:[ONLINE] PATC: Introduction to HPC for Life Scientists
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1003
DESCRIPTION:<p>This course introduces HPC to life science researchers\, 
 focusing on the aspects that are most important for those new to this 
 technology to understand. It will help you judge how HPC can best benefit 
 your research\, and equip you to go on to successfully and efficiently 
 make use of HPC facilities in future. The course will cover basic concepts
  in HPC hardware\, software\, user environments\, filesystems\, and 
 programming models. It also provides an opportunity to gain hands-on 
 practical experience and assistance using an HPC system (MARENOSTRUM) 
 through examples drawn from the life sciences\, such as biomolecular 
 simulation.</p>

SUMMARY:GROMACS Workshop
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/827
DESCRIPTION:<p>Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations are fundamental to 
 understand the mechanism of biological systems. This workshop aims to 
 provide an introduction on the use and on the features of a well-
 established and highly used package in the field GROMACS.</p> <p>The 
 workshop covers an introduction to MD simulation\, to accelerated weight 
 histogram methods and to GraphicsGraphical Processing Units (GPU) 
 performance. At the end the participants will be familiar with the
