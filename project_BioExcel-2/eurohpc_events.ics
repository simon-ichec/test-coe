SUMMARY:Co-Design for HPC in Computational Materials and Molecular Science
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1443
DESCRIPTION:<p>The Workshop on HPC (High Performance Computing) Co-design 
 in Computational Materials and Molecular Science was initiated and is led 
 by the NOMAD Center of Excellence (www.nomad-coe.eu)\, and is organised by
  NOMAD in collaboration with the BioExcel\, MAX\, and TREX CoEs. </p> 
 <p>The workshop will gather contributions from leading scientists\, 
 technologies\, and SW engineers from the fields of academia\, HPC 
 centres\, HW-vendors\, and industry. The workshop covers a broad range of 
 current topics\, taking materials and molecular science codes as reference
  HPC applications and possible co-design vehicles. </p> <p>The topics to 
 be covered are:</p> <p>(1) existing examples of HPC co-design in materials
  and molecular science\,</p> <p>(2) co-design of general purpose and 
 domain-specific libraries\, kernels\, and mini-apps\, and</p> <p>(3) the 
 perspective of hardware manufacturers\, integrators\, and data center 
 owners.</p> <p>The workshop will focus in particular on\, and attempt to 
 draw conclusions about:</p> <p>(1) the relationship between algorithms and
  computer architectures in materials science\,</p> <p>(2) the connection 
 between parallel programming technologies and runtime systems\, and</p> 
 <p>(3) the interplay of the above layers for a wide spectrum of computer 
 architectures\, within the selected scientific domain. </p> <p>We aim to 
 identify how scientific software developers in materials science can 
 influence hardware manufacturers as well as middleware and system-level 
 software developers\, and vice versa. In particular\, we seek to determine
  how co-design is employed in the development of the new HPC processors 
 and of the related software stack\, including with respect to compilers 
 and optimized libraries\, schedulers and IO\, and container technologies. 
 </p> <p>Hardware HPC vendors and integrators will share their vision on 
 co-design\, while key people from the scientific software development 
 community will discuss the adoption of state-of-the-art technologies when 
 porting their codes on emerging computer architectures. Consequently\, the
  workshop will provide a rare and valuable opportunity to foster close 
 contacts and the exchange of ideas between the scientific and technical 
 communities.</p>

 two methods to calculate the free energy associated with an alchemical 
 transformation: Bennett acceptance ratio method (BAR) and accelerated 
 weighted histogram (AWH). The tutorials are implemented in Jupyter 
 notebook and cover how to perform a simple alchemical transformation and 
 compute the associated free energy change (e.i solvation free energy) 
 using the two approaches in GROMACS </p> <p><strong>Audience: 
 </strong>These sessions are aimed at people interested in:<br> 1) Starting
  to compute free energy using GROMACS.<br> 2) Understanding the difference
  between the approaches available in GROMACS for alchemical 
 transformation. </p> <p><strong>Pre-requisites: </strong>A minimum 
 knowledge of thermodynamics and minimum expertise in using GROMACS to 
 perform Molecular Dynamics calculation are needed to attend the training. 
 Moreover\, minimum Linux skills are also required. Please consult the 
 following materials\, if you’re uncertain of your Linux\, GROMACS and 
 Jupyter notebook skills:</p> <ul> <li>GROMACS <a

SUMMARY:QM/MM with GROMACS + CP2K
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1458
DESCRIPTION:<p><strong>Learning outcomes</strong><br> This course will 
 equip participants to perform hybrid QM/MM simulations using the molecular
  dynamics code GROMACS in combination with the quantum chemistry package 
 CP2K through an interface developed by one of the instructors from the 
 BioExcel Centre of Excellence (www.bioexcel.eu).</p> 
 <p><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br> Participants should be familiar with
  using GROMACS to perform molecular dynamics simulations. A background in 
 computational quantum chemistry is not strictly required since an 
 introduction of key aspects will be provided\, but previous familiarity is
  beneficial. You should be familiar with connecting to a remote machine 
 using ssh and will benefit from experience using an HPC facility as you 
 will execute hands-on practicals on the UK supercomputer ARCHER2.</p> 
 <p><strong>Description</strong><br> Most classical molecular mechanics 
 (MM) force fields are not sufficiently flexible to model processes in 
 which chemical bonds are broken or formed. Instead\, some level of quantum
  mechanical (QM) description is needed to gain detailed mechanistic 
 insights into reaction mechanisms\, e.g. the catalytic action of enzymes\,
  and to compute photochemical properties such as absorption and emission 
 spectra of fluorescent proteins. However biochemical systems (including 
 solvent) are too large to be solved in their entirety at ab initio QM 
 level or efficiently even with a high-quality density functional theory 
 (DFT) approximation. To overcome the cost of a QM description on the one 
 hand versus the limitations of a MM treatment on the other hand\, methods 
 have been developed that treat a small critical region of interest at QM 
 level while retaining the computationally cheaper MM force field for the 
 majority of the system.</p> <p>Despite the simplicity of the QM/MM 
 concept\, its application is currently restricted to a relatively small 
 group of specialised expert users often using in-house codes. To unlock 
 the power of QM/MM simulations for the wider biomolecular simulation 
 community\, the BioExcel Centre of Excellence has developed an interface 
 between the molecular dynamics code GROMACS\, which is widely used in the 
 biomolecular simulation community\, and the quantum chemistry package 
 CP2K\, which supports calculations under periodic boundary conditions with
  DFT methods.</p> <p>This course explains key aspects relating to the use 
 of QM/MM for biomolecular simulation with these two codes and equips 
 participants with the ability to start using GROMACS and CP2K for this 
 purpose in their own research. Participants are provided with the 
 opportunity to gain hands-on practical experience running several example 
 calculations on ARCHER2\, the UK national supercomputing service.</p>

SUMMARY:Practical introduction to QM/MM using CP2K for biomolecular 
 modelling
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1463
DESCRIPTION:<p>As a collaboration between ARCHER2 Training and BioExcel\, 
 this free online course consists of interactive hands-on practical 
 sessions presented remotely using Collaborate. Attendees will be given 
 access to ARCHER to execute the practical.</p> <p>The course will run over
  two Tuesday afternoons\, 13th and 20th October. Participants are expected
  to attend both sessions. Each session will run from 13:30-16:00 with a 
 break 14:30-15:00. There will be a follow-up consultancy session\, where 
 you can drop-in to ask questions of the tutor on Tuesday 3rd November 
 14:00-16:00</p> <h3>Outline</h3> <p>CP2K is a quantum chemistry and solid 
 state physics software package that can perform atomistic simulations of a
  wide variety of systems\, ranging from solid state to biological systems.
  CP2K provides a general framework for running density functional theory 
 (DFT) simulations\, with extensions that enable users to run classical 
 molecular dynamics (MD)\, mix MD and DFT to obtain quantum-
 mechanical/molecular-dynamics (QM/MM) runs\, or perform other forms of 
 metadynamics\, Monte Carlo\, or other simulations.</p> <p>This course is 
 aiming to teach attendees how to prepare and run biochemical simulations 
 in CP2K. Specifically\, we will be looking at how CP2K can be used to 
 track the reaction dynamics of a system undergoing biological catalysis. 
 In this course\, we shall be focusing on a Diels Alder transition taking 
 place in an immunoglobulin. We will begin by considering the reaction site
  in a purely quantum-mechanical method. Then\, we will slowly increase the
  complexity of the system to take into account the entire structure of the
  immunoglobulin (using QM/MM approach)\, the solution\, and finally\, we 
 will add a ligand to the reaction.</p> <p>While we will be referencing 
 some DFT and QM/MM theory (mainly the nudged elastic band method and 
 metadynamics)\, this is not the principal aim of this course. Our aim is 
 to use these systems to help familiarise attendees with using CP2K to run 
 simulations of biochemical systems. CP2K can be used for non-biological 
 systems\, and the topics being taught here can be ported to other fields\,
  but this will not be a primary focus of this course.</p> <h3>Learning 
 outcomes</h3> <p>At the end of this session\, you will be able to:</p> 
 <ul> <li>Run a geometry optimisation using CP2K</li> <li>Run a frequency 
 calculation using CP2K</li> <li>Estimate the energy barrier of a chemical 
 reaction</li> <li>Run a nudged elastic band (NEB) simulation to fine-tune 
 the energy barrier and profile of a chemical reaction</li> <li>Prepare a 
 QM/MM simulation for CP2K</li> <li>Run a QM/MM simulation in CP2K</li>

DESCRIPTION:<p><strong>Overview</strong></p> <p>Are you interested in 
 computational biomolecular simulation methods such as Molecular Dynamics 
 simulations\, but scared to make the first step? What if you could start 
 smoothly using interactive\, graphical user interfaces like Jupyter 
 Notebooks? What if you could easily build pipelines chaining different 
 programs using a single\, interoperable library with a unique syntax?</p> 
 <p>Join the online training session where we will introduce the <a 
 href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0177-4">BioExcel building
  blocks</a>\, a fully interoperable software library comprising a 
 collection of Python wrappers on top of biomolecular simulation tools such
  as GROMACS\, Ambertools\, Openbabel or ACPYPE. The philosophy behind its 
 design\, following best practices and FAIR principles for software 
 development makes it easy to find\, install and use\, increasing 
 reproducibility and (re)usability. Demonstration workflows implemented in 
 Jupyter notebooks using the library will be presented and explained step 
 by step (e.g. protein-ligand complex GROMACS MD setup). The first steps on
  how to build and run complex workflows in command-line will be 
 explored.</p> <p><strong>Audience</strong></p> <p>This session is aimed at
  people interested in:</p> <ul> <li>Starting with computational 
 biomolecular simulations\, and more specifically Molecular Dynamics 
 simulations.</li> <li>Building computational biomolecular simulations 
 workflows\, ensuring reproducibility.</li> <li>No expertise in Molecular 
 Dynamics is needed to attend the training\, although some knowledge and 
 familiarity with this method is recommended to properly follow the course.
  Minimum Linux skills are also required.</li> <li>This is an interactive 
 session that is presented remotely using GoToTraining</li> </ul> 
 <p><strong>Learning outcomes</strong></p> <p>At the end of this session 
 you will be able to:</p> <ul> <li>Interactively work with computational 
 biomolecular simulation demonstration workflows built using the BioExcel
