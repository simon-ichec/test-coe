SUMMARY:TREX Build-system Hackathon
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1327
DESCRIPTION:<p>Making HPC software easy to install on multiple 
 supercomputers or different architectures is a difficult task: different 
 systems have different compilers\, libraries\, system commands etc. This 
 task can be helped by tools like <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> 
 and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">GNU 
 Autotools</a>.</p> <p>In this Hackathon\, we will help code developers 
 better understand how to use these build systems to improve the 
 portability of their applications. In addition\, well-done configuration 
 scripts facilitate the packaging of the software\, and presentations will 
 be given to propose different packaging possibilities to distribute the 
 software.</p> <p>This Hackathon is a multi-day virtual event targeting 
 students\, engineers and researchers developing HPC open-source software. 
 It aims at helping teams of one to six developers improve the build 
 scripts of codes they develop. The supported build systems for this 
 Hackathon are Autotools and CMake.</p>
