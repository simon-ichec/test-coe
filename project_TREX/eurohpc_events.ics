SUMMARY:Co-Design for HPC in Computational Materials and Molecular Science
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1443
DESCRIPTION:<p>The Workshop on HPC (High Performance Computing) Co-design 
 in Computational Materials and Molecular Science was initiated and is led 
 by the NOMAD Center of Excellence (www.nomad-coe.eu)\, and is organised by
  NOMAD in collaboration with the BioExcel\, MAX\, and TREX CoEs. </p> 
 <p>The workshop will gather contributions from leading scientists\, 
 technologies\, and SW engineers from the fields of academia\, HPC 
 centres\, HW-vendors\, and industry. The workshop covers a broad range of 
 current topics\, taking materials and molecular science codes as reference
  HPC applications and possible co-design vehicles. </p> <p>The topics to 
 be covered are:</p> <p>(1) existing examples of HPC co-design in materials
  and molecular science\,</p> <p>(2) co-design of general purpose and 
 domain-specific libraries\, kernels\, and mini-apps\, and</p> <p>(3) the 
 perspective of hardware manufacturers\, integrators\, and data center 
 owners.</p> <p>The workshop will focus in particular on\, and attempt to 
 draw conclusions about:</p> <p>(1) the relationship between algorithms and
  computer architectures in materials science\,</p> <p>(2) the connection 
 between parallel programming technologies and runtime systems\, and</p> 
 <p>(3) the interplay of the above layers for a wide spectrum of computer 
 architectures\, within the selected scientific domain. </p> <p>We aim to 
 identify how scientific software developers in materials science can 
 influence hardware manufacturers as well as middleware and system-level 
 software developers\, and vice versa. In particular\, we seek to determine
  how co-design is employed in the development of the new HPC processors 
 and of the related software stack\, including with respect to compilers 
 and optimized libraries\, schedulers and IO\, and container technologies. 
 </p> <p>Hardware HPC vendors and integrators will share their vision on 
 co-design\, while key people from the scientific software development 
 community will discuss the adoption of state-of-the-art technologies when 
 porting their codes on emerging computer architectures. Consequently\, the
  workshop will provide a rare and valuable opportunity to foster close 
 contacts and the exchange of ideas between the scientific and technical 
 communities.</p>

SUMMARY:TREX Build-system Hackathon
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1327
DESCRIPTION:<p>Making HPC software easy to install on multiple 
 supercomputers or different architectures is a difficult task: different 
 systems have different compilers\, libraries\, system commands etc. This 
 task can be helped by tools like <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> 
 and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">GNU 
 Autotools</a>.</p> <p>In this Hackathon\, we will help code developers 
 better understand how to use these build systems to improve the 
 portability of their applications. In addition\, well-done configuration 
 scripts facilitate the packaging of the software\, and presentations will 
 be given to propose different packaging possibilities to distribute the 
 software.</p> <p>This Hackathon is a multi-day virtual event targeting 
 students\, engineers and researchers developing HPC open-source software. 
 It aims at helping teams of one to six developers improve the build 
 scripts of codes they develop. The supported build systems for this 
 Hackathon are Autotools and CMake.</p>
