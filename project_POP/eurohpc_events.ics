SUMMARY:41st VI-HPS Tuning Workshop (online)
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/999
DESCRIPTION:<p>This workshop organised by VI-HPS\, Jülich Supercomputing 
 Centre &amp\; RWTH Aachen ITC will:</p> <ul> <li>give an overview of the 
 VI-HPS programming tools suite</li> <li>explain the functionality of 
 individual tools\, and how to use them effectively</li> <li>offer hands-on
  experience and expert coaching assistance using the tools</li> <li>with 
 your own application running on multi-GPU compute nodes</li> </ul> <p>On 
 completion participants should be familiar with common performance 
 analysis and diagnosis techniques and how they can be employed in practice
  (on a range of HPC systems). Those who prepared their own application 
 test cases will have been coached in the tuning of their measurement and 
 analysis\, and provided optimization suggestions.</p>
