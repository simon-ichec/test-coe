SUMMARY:Modeling Materials at Realistic time Scales via Optimal 
 Exploitation of Exascale Computers and Artificial Intelligence
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1442
DESCRIPTION:<p>The event is planned in terms of two stages: a high-level 
 CECAM workshop and a subsequent hands-on tutorial. Both activities address
  the concepts and implementations that are needed in order to link the 
 Quantum Mechanical (QM) description of electrons in materials\, to the 
 statistical mechanics principles that address the larger time and length 
 scales governing real-life situations.</p> <p>During the first 3 days\, 
 the workshop will focus on recent and important developments 
 addressing<strong> exascale scientific computing applications </strong>and
  related<strong> artificial intelligence (AI) methods\, </strong>with a 
 specific focus on urgent and critical aspects in the domain of 
 computational materials science. In particular\, we will address how 
 exascale computing can contribute to the enhanced performance of materials
  modeling\, in terms of higher accuracy\, precision and degree of inter-
 operability between different modeling length- and time-scales. These 
 technical aspects will be <strong>presented and discussed by leading 
 experts in different domains</strong>\, thus giving the opportunity to 
 explore similarities and differences in the various current state-of-the-
 art approaches towards exascale computing\, as well as the management of 
 modeling workflows and corresponding output data of interesting materials 
 properties.</p> <p>Then the following 2 days will consist of tutorials and
  hands-on demonstrations that will focus on recent progress in (1) first 
 principles simulations and (2) advanced sampling methods and software\, 
 and (3) the coupling of first principles molecular dynamics simulations 
 and advanced sampling methods. In particular\, examples using the <a 
 href="http://qboxcode.org/">Qbox</a> code coupled with with the <a 
 href="https://ssagesproject.github.io/">SSAGES suite of codes</a> and <a 
 href="http://ipi-code.org/">I-Pi</a> will be discussed in detail\, with 
 several hands-on examples.</p> <h3>General Scope</h3> <p>Real materials 
 are not necessarily in thermal equilibrium\, and a careful understanding 
 of the micro-structure of any material (e.g. grains and grain boundaries) 
 is crucial for the estimation of important materials properties and 
 functions. Thus\, QM techniques have necessarily to be connected to 
 molecular mechanics (MM)\, large-scale molecular dynamics (MD)\, kinetic 
 Monte Carlo (kMC)\, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD)\, just to name 
 a few methodologies. Very importantly\, we need robust connections between
  all such modelling techniques\, including a detailed understanding of the
  various errors and uncertainties involved. Moreover\, in order to 
 properly interpret the corresponding results\, we need all such inter-
 connections to be fully reversible\, i.e. not just able to transition from
  small to large scales but also conversely.</p> <p>The Handbook of 
 Materials Modeling (2005) is one of the main classical references in this 
 domain of scientific computing [1]\, and its 2nd edition has since 
 appeared in 2020 [2]. This has now turned into a six-volume major review 
 masterwork\, reflecting the significant developments in all aspects 
 pertaining to computational materials research over the past decade or 
 so\, including major progress in the formulation of increasingly realistic
  multi-scale modeling approaches\, workflows and models. However\, two 
 recent innovations in materials modeling applications are still relatively
  poorly and sparsely covered in the currently available review 
 literature\, namely <strong>exascale computing</strong> and related 
 <strong>artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods</strong>. These two 
 topics will be the main focus of our attention within our proposed 
 workshop and associated tutorial school.</p> <p>[1] Handbook of Materials

 <p>The event will start with a <strong>high-level workshop (3 
 days)</strong>. Talks\, discussions\, and poster sessions will be held as 
 a<strong> regular meeting involving the physical presence of all 
 participants</strong> (some but very few talks may be presented 
 virtually).</p> <p>Each of the five main sessions during the first part of
  the workshop (throughout the first three days) will start with an 
 <strong>introduction (15 minutes)</strong> by a renowned scientist\, the 
 so-called <strong>“moderator”</strong> for that particular session. The 
 subsequent talks in the corresponding session will then last for 
 <strong>30 minutes each</strong>\, and will be followed in turn by 
 <strong>10 minutes of general Q&amp\;A discussion</strong>.</p> <p>The

SUMMARY:Extended Software Development Workshop in HPC for mesoscale 
 simulation
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/971
DESCRIPTION:<p>Mesoscale simulations have grown recently in importance due 
 to their capacity of capturing molecular and atomistic effects without 
 having to solve for a prohibitively large number of particles needed in 
 Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations. Different approaches\, emerging from a
  coarse approximation to a group of atoms and molecules\, allow 
 reproducing both chemical and physical main properties as well as 
 continuum behaviour such as the hydrodynamics of fluid flows.</p> <p>One 
 of the most common techniques is the Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD): 
 an approximate\, coarse-grain\, mesoscale simulation method for 
 investigating phenomena between the atomic and the continuum scale world\,
  like flows through complex geometries\, micro fluids\, phase behaviours 
 and polymer processing. It consists of an off-lattice\, discrete particle 
 method similar to MD but with replacement of a soft potential for the 
 conservative force\, a random force to simulate the Brownian motion of the
  particles and a drag force to balance the random force and conserve the 
 total momentum of the system.</p> <p>However\, real applications usually 
 consist of a large number of particles and despite the coarse grain 
 approximation\, compared to MD\, High Performance Computing (HPC) is often
  required for simulating systems of industrial and scientific interest. On
  the other hand\, today’s hardware is quickly moving towards hybrid CPU-
 GPU architectures. In fact\, five of the top ten supercomputer are made of
  mixed CPU and NVidia GPU accelerators which allow to achieve hundreds of 
 PetaFlops performance. This type of architecture is also one of the main 
 paths toward Exascale.</p> <p>Few software\, like DL_MESO\, userMESO and 
 LAMMPS\, can currently simulate large DPD simulations. In particular\, 
 DL_MESO has recently been ported to multi-GPU architectures and runs 
 efficiently up to 4096 GPUs. This allows investigating very large system 
 with billions of particles within affordable computational effort. 
 However\, additional effort is required to enable the current version to 
 cover more complex physics\, like long range forces as well as achieving 
 higher parallel computing efficiency.</p> <p>The purpose of this Extended 
 Software Development Workshop (ESDW) is to introduce students to the 
 parallel programming of hybrid CPU-GPU systems. The intention is not only 
 to port mesoscale solvers on GPUs\, but also to expose the community to 
 this new programming paradigm\, which they can benefit from in their own 
 fields of research. See more details about the topics covered by this ESDW
