SUMMARY:Extended Software Development Workshop in HPC for mesoscale 
 simulation
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/971
DESCRIPTION:<p>Mesoscale simulations have grown recently in importance due 
 to their capacity of capturing molecular and atomistic effects without 
 having to solve for a prohibitively large number of particles needed in 
 Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations. Different approaches\, emerging from a
  coarse approximation to a group of atoms and molecules\, allow 
 reproducing both chemical and physical main properties as well as 
 continuum behaviour such as the hydrodynamics of fluid flows.</p> <p>One 
 of the most common techniques is the Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD): 
 an approximate\, coarse-grain\, mesoscale simulation method for 
 investigating phenomena between the atomic and the continuum scale world\,
  like flows through complex geometries\, micro fluids\, phase behaviours 
 and polymer processing. It consists of an off-lattice\, discrete particle 
 method similar to MD but with replacement of a soft potential for the 
 conservative force\, a random force to simulate the Brownian motion of the
  particles and a drag force to balance the random force and conserve the 
 total momentum of the system.</p> <p>However\, real applications usually 
 consist of a large number of particles and despite the coarse grain 
 approximation\, compared to MD\, High Performance Computing (HPC) is often
  required for simulating systems of industrial and scientific interest. On
  the other hand\, today’s hardware is quickly moving towards hybrid CPU-
 GPU architectures. In fact\, five of the top ten supercomputer are made of
  mixed CPU and NVidia GPU accelerators which allow to achieve hundreds of 
 PetaFlops performance. This type of architecture is also one of the main 
 paths toward Exascale.</p> <p>Few software\, like DL_MESO\, userMESO and 
 LAMMPS\, can currently simulate large DPD simulations. In particular\, 
 DL_MESO has recently been ported to multi-GPU architectures and runs 
 efficiently up to 4096 GPUs. This allows investigating very large system 
 with billions of particles within affordable computational effort. 
 However\, additional effort is required to enable the current version to 
 cover more complex physics\, like long range forces as well as achieving 
 higher parallel computing efficiency.</p> <p>The purpose of this Extended 
 Software Development Workshop (ESDW) is to introduce students to the 
 parallel programming of hybrid CPU-GPU systems. The intention is not only 
 to port mesoscale solvers on GPUs\, but also to expose the community to 
 this new programming paradigm\, which they can benefit from in their own 
 fields of research. See more details about the topics covered by this ESDW
