SUMMARY:Data management and publication â€“ A DICE & CompBioMed Hackathon
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1485
DESCRIPTION:<p>Join us for an exciting <strong>Hackathon</strong> where you
  will obtain hands-on experience in using the <strong>new 
 services</strong> implemented in the <strong>CompBioMed project over the 
 DICE facilities</strong>.</p> <p>Find out how computational biomedical 
 researchers are using the DICE Data Management services to manage their 
 federated data in a FAIR way.</p> <p>If you are a researcher or programmer
  responsible for implementing data handling in your project\, then this 
 hackathon is for you! We will spend an entire afternoon together on the 
 premises of the CINECA High-Performance Computing Centre <strong>in 
 Bologna\, Italy.</strong> Bring your own computer\, and samples of your 
 data that you would like to work on.</p>

SUMMARY:Online course Cluster computing for computational science
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1486
DESCRIPTION:<h2>Practical training to learn how to use a supercomputer</h2>
  <p>If you have to perform many calculations or analyses that are too 
 large for your own system\, clusters and supercomputers provide the 
 necessary computing power. In this training you do practical exercises to 
 learn how to use a supercomputer facility effectively\, in particular with
  the national compute cluster Lisa and the national supercomputer 
 Cartesius.</p> <p>Moreover\, you get to know some examples of real-world 
 scientific simulations with significant computational requirements\, such 
 as blood flow simulations and protein docking\, and therefore you learn 
 about the different needs for parallel executions for them.</p> <p>This 
 course is sponsored by the <a href="https://www.compbiomed.eu/">CompBioMed
  Center of Excellence</a>.</p> <h2>Program</h2> <ul> <li>Session 1 (3 
 December\, 15:00 - 19:00): Learn how to work with a supercomputer and 
 advanced Linux tools with hands-on exercises</li> <li>Session 2 (10 
 December\, 15:00 - 19:00): Parallel computing and applications for 
 computational science with hands-on exercises</li> </ul> <h2>For 
 whom?</h2> <p>This course aims at anyone who wants to know how to perform 
 huge compute tasks applied to different scientific fields. The working 
 language is English.</p> <h2>Requirements</h2> <p>Basic knowledge of <a 
 href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/">Unix shell</a> is 
 useful.</p>
