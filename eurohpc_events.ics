SUMMARY:NOMAD&#039\;s Midsummer School: Towards exascale solutions in Green
  function methods and advanced DFT
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1325
DESCRIPTION:<p>With 10^18 floating point operations per second\, exascale 
 computers will be able to simulate and analyze complex processes in real 
 materials more realistically than what is possible today. This will allow 
 to study systems of higher complexity (in space and time) and to achieve 
 higher accuracy and precision. In close contact with academia and 
 industry\, the <strong>NOMAD CoE</strong> will develop exascale software\,
  artificial intelligence (Al) methods\, and efficient workflows for an 
 advanced materials modeling. The <strong>NOMAD School focusses on 
 "exascale solutions in Green function methods and advanced 
 DFT"</strong>.</p> <p> The NOMAD School features <strong>50-minute 
 tutorial lectures </strong>by renowned scientists of the field (see below 
 and the PROGRAM) who will introduce their respective topics and address 
 recent exascale achievements and prevailing challenges.</p> <p> NOMAD 
 anticipates that the exascale challenge\, which shows "exaflops" 
 performance in some components of the codes\, will be met by workflows 
 handling high-throughput calculations and/or complex ensemble averages of 
 statistical mechanics and artificial intelligence. To get more practical 
 insights into all these topics\, there will be hands-on tutorials and/or 
 hackathons in the afternoon\, run in parallel by key developers of the 
 codes Abinit\, exciting\, FHI-aims\, <strong>GPAW</strong>\, and by 
 <strong>developers of ASE/ASR\, CC4S and Mini-Apps</strong>. For 
 example:</p> <ul> <li>people presently using code A can learn about the 
 possible advantages of code B.</li> <li>people using any of the codes can 
 learn about and contribute to the workflow management of ASE/AS R.</li> 
 <li>people using any of the codes can learn about and contribute to the 
 development of the INTERFACE towards CC4S (coupled cluster for 
 solids).</li> <li>people using any of the codes can learn about and 
 contribute to the development of mini apps to check and analyze their code
  performance.</li> </ul> <p>The school is aimed at graduate students and 
 early-career postdocs. </p>

SUMMARY:ONLINE Numerical methods for Large Eddy Simulation
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1339
DESCRIPTION:<p>The <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> code is a 
 parallel code of fluid mechanics that solves compressible Navier-Stokes 
 equations for laminar and turbulent reactive flows\, in 2D and 3D\, on 
 unstructured and hybrid meshes\, with third order Taylor Galerkin schemes.
  The resolution of these equations is based on the Large Eddy Simulation 
 (or Large Eddy Simulation) approach. Reduced chemical kinetics according 
 to the Arrhenius law coupled to the TFLES model for sub-grid flame-
 turbulence interactions make possible to treat combustion phenomena. <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> can also 
 calculate two-phase flows using a Lagrangian or Eulerian solver. <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> applies to 
 aeronautical combustion chambers\, turbomachinery\, industrial furnaces 
 and safety issues\, it allows for example to evaluate polluting emissions 
 (CO\, NOx and soot)\, to treat thermo-acoustic instabilities or detonation
  phenomena. <a href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> 
 is a world-famous code in the field of combustion\, used by many 
 laboratories (IMFT in Toulouse\, EM2C in Centralesupelec\, TU Munich\, Von
  Karmann Institute\, ETH Zurich\, etc.) and in industry (SAFRAN AIRCRAFT 
 ENGINES\, SAFRAN HELICOPTER ENGINES\, ARIANEGROUP\, HERAKLES\, TOTAL\, 
 etc.).</p>

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:<!DOCTYPE HTML><HTML><BODY><p>The <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> code is a 
 parallel code of fluid mechanics that solves compressible Navier-Stokes 
 equations for laminar and turbulent reactive flows, in 2D and 3D, on 
 unstructured and hybrid meshes, with third order Taylor Galerkin schemes. 
 The resolution of these equations is based on the Large Eddy Simulation 
 (or Large Eddy Simulation) approach. Reduced chemical kinetics according 
 to the Arrhenius law coupled to the TFLES model for sub-grid flame-
 turbulence interactions make possible to treat combustion phenomena. <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> can also 
 calculate two-phase flows using a Lagrangian or Eulerian solver. <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> applies to 
 aeronautical combustion chambers, turbomachinery, industrial furnaces and 
 safety issues, it allows for example to evaluate polluting emissions (CO, 
 NOx and soot), to treat thermo-acoustic instabilities or detonation 
 phenomena. <a href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> is
  a world-famous code in the field of combustion, used by many laboratories
  (IMFT in Toulouse, EM2C in Centralesupelec, TU Munich, Von Karmann 
 Institute, ETH Zurich, etc.) and in industry (SAFRAN AIRCRAFT ENGINES, 
 SAFRAN HELICOPTER ENGINES, ARIANEGROUP, HERAKLES, TOTAL,

SUMMARY:MaX school: Ab-initio Many-Body Methods and Simulations with the 
 Yambo Code
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1318
DESCRIPTION:<p>The Computational School on <em>Ab-initio Many-body Methods 
 and Simulations with the Yambo Code</em> will introduce many-body 
 perturbation theory (MBPT) approaches and specifically to<em> first-
 principles</em> excited-state simulations using the YAMBO code.</p> <p>The
  target participants are graduate students\, postdocs\, and researchers 
 who are interested in learning or in improving their knowledge and skills 
 to calculate electronic and optical properties of materials\, beyond the 
 well-known DFT limitations and using an efficient\, highly parallelized 
 and accurate many-body computational tool.</p> <p>Both theoretical and 
 technical lectures will be offered as well as dedicated hands-on sessions 
 where students will learn how to use the code for materials of current 
 research interest and how to optimize its use in a parallel environment. 
 Several post-processing tools for the analysis of the results will be also
  introduced and practically applied.</p> <p>General topics will include 
 self-energy and quasiparticles concepts\, the GW approximation\, and the 
 Bethe-Salpeter equation\, all placed in the context of and linked with 
 experimental measurements (photoemission\, absorption\, 
 photoluminescence).</p> <p>At variance with previous editions\, this 
 school will present some advanced lectures such as:</p> <p>new algorithms 
 developed to deal with electron-phonon interactions\, real time evolution 
 of equations of motion\, time dependent polarization in terms of the Berry
  phase\, and computation of non-linear optical properties.</p> <p>The 
 specific usage in massively parallel environments equipped with modern 
 accelerated video cards (GPU’s) will be introduced.</p> <p>

SUMMARY:Optimizing Digital Teaching and Communication
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1370
DESCRIPTION:<p>In September 2021 we will hold a hands-on workshop on 
 e-learning techniques and strategies\, under the aegis of CECAM\, Psi-k 
 and the MaX (Material Design at Exascale) European Center of Excellence\, 
 aimed at teachers and researchers in electronic structure and HPC in 
 general.</p> <p>Join us!</p> <p>In this new world after the pandemic\, 
 experience and needs of those preparing online teaching have evolved. 
 Therefore\, we are organizing a hands-on workshop on online and blended 
 teaching\, that addresses the needs of the post-Covid era. There are 
 plenty of reasons to keep elements of teaching in an online form 
 permanently. </p> <p>Some workshop objectives are:</p> <ul> <li> How can 
 we learn from the past year? </li> <li> How can we <strong>offer our 
 online</strong> and blended <strong>teaching</strong> in a way that leads 
 <strong>to better learning and increased student satisfaction</strong>? 
 </li> <li> What are the <strong>pitfalls we must avoid</strong>? </li> 
 </ul> <p>We’ve set ourselves the challenge to bring this information to 
 you in an online format that will keep you engaged and motivated.</p> <ul>
  <li> You will <strong>leave the workshop with a set of online teaching 
 materials you will have prepared</strong>\, for your own courses\, talks 
 or science communication. </li> <li> You will not have the chance to hide 
 yourself anonymously behind your laptop\, and you <strong>will learn how 
 to avoid the same for your students or your audience.</strong> </li> </ul>
  <p>If you participate in this online workshop\, you may expect:</p> 
 <p>First a short self-paced online preparation course\, which you can take
  at any time between mid-August and mid-September 2021 (duration: 2-4 
 hours). Here you will learn the very basics\, and you will be guided to 
 set up the soft- and hardware you will need during the workshop (e.g. 
 video editing software\, polling tools\, ...).</p> <p>Four 3-hour live 
 online sessions spread from September 15 to September 22 (a detailed 
 timing will follow). During and after every session (yes\, there will be 
 home-work !) you will work on several tasks\, in small teams together with
  other participants.</p> <p>After September 22\, you will be given a 
 larger task that deals with a topic of your choice (e.g. something you 
 will need to teach about at your institute\, or a lecture you will have to
  give\, or simply a science topic you like). You will work on this for one
  week\, in interaction with a small team of other participants.</p> <p>On 
 October 1\, there is a final 3-hour online session where you will see what
  (some of) the other participants accomplished\, and where you will get 
 collective feedback as well as peer feedback on your work. </p> <p>If you 
 are interested to participate\, you should register in two different steps
  (both steps are mandatory):</p> <p>Step 1: register at CECAM<a

SUMMARY:ONLINE Training on Nek5000 @ENCCS/EXCELLERAT
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/856
DESCRIPTION:<p>In this one-day training\, we will give an overview of the 
 capabilities and features of Nek5000\, together with a hands-on session to
  install\, run and postprocess some comparably simple flow cases. Nek5000 
 is a spectral-element based solver for CFD\, and is available as an open 
 source package. The code has become popular among researchers worldwide\, 
 mainly because of its relatively high accuracy per grid point\, its 
 parallel efficiency and the wide user community and available packages 
 (e.g. statistics\, linear stability\, adjoints etc.).</p> <p>The 
 development of the various methods goes back to the mid 80s\, and a number
  of different approaches is now implemented\, both when it comes to the 
 integration of Navier-Stokes\, the communication kernels and efficient 
 single-core performance. There are also advanced capabilities when it 
 comes to meshing\, turbulence models\, moving meshes that make Nek5000 
 attractive even for more industrially relevant flows. The benefit of high 
 order and efficient parallelisation is clearly a distinguishing feature in
  situations when high fidelity simulation data is required.</p>

SUMMARY:First-principles simulations of materials with SIESTA
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1369
DESCRIPTION:<p>The school is aimed at students and researchers from 
 different disciplines who already use\, or plan to use\, first-principles 
 techniques to simulate properties of matter at the atomic scale. In 
 particular\, the school will focus on the SIESTA method [1\,2]. 
 Participants will learn its essential theoretical foundations\, and how to
  use the SIESTA code effectively. Pre- and post-processing tools will also
  be presented. The format of the school (completely online) allows for a 
 flexible offering of modules of different levels\, from basic to 
 advanced\, so that participants can adapt their syllabus. In addition\, 
 the material prepared for the school will be integrated into the corpus of
  SIESTA documentation\, which will remain available for continuous 
 learning.</p> <p><strong>FORMAT</strong></p> <p>The School will be 
 formally held in the week of June 28 -- July 2nd\, 2021\, but the week 
 before participants are expected to watch pre-recorded lectures\, prepare 
 their local computer setup [3]\, and work on simple exercises. Throughout 
 the School week\, live meetings will be offered in two tracks (morning and
  afternoon in Central-European Summer Time) to try to adapt to an audience
  distributed over different time zones\, and will consist of reviews of 
 relevant concepts (with Q&amp\;A sections) and guided hands-on 
 exercises.</p> <p>An online support forum will be open before\, during\, 
 and for some time after the canonical school dates to provide further 
 guidance\, to answer questions\, and to facilitate discussions between 
 school students and tutors.</p> <p><strong>COURSE MATERIALS</strong></p> 
 <p>The materials for the school will consist of:</p> <ul> <li>Pre-recorded
  video lectures covering the necessary theoretical background and/or how-
 to's for specific features.</li> <li>An online repository of documentation
  and how-to guides.</li> <li>A virtual machine or container\, based on the
  Quantum Mobile [3]\, packaged with the necessary codes and supporting 
 school files\, for the hands-on exercises.</li> </ul> 
 <p><strong>PROGRAM</strong></p> <p>The live sessions of the school will 
 take place from 09:30 to 12:30 CEST (Track A) and from 16:00 to 19:00 CEST
  (Track B)\, with breaks. It is expected that two modules will be covered 
 in each session.</p> <p>Background lectures and hands-on modules will 
 cover an assortment of topics\, from basic and fundamental to advanced. 
 Students focusing on basic to medium level topics will be able to work on 
 the relevant modules throughout the school. More advanced students will be
  able to prepare their own selection of topics.</p> <p>(Please check <a 
 href="https://siesta-project.org/siesta/events/SIESTA_School-2021/">this 
 page</a> for updates and further details.)</p> 
 <p><strong>REGISTRATION</strong></p> <p>Persons interested in registering 
 for the School need to <strong>submit two registration forms</strong>. 
 </p> <p>First\, they must apply through the “Participate” tab of<a 
 href="https://members.cecam.org/login"> the CECAM web page</a>. </p> 
 <p>Second\, they need to submit the online form at <a href="https://forms.
 office.com/r/BQYpMkku4V">https://forms.office.com/r/BQYpMkku4V</a> using 
 the same email address that they provided to CECAM.</p> <p>Apart from 
 basic identification and affiliation data\, prospective students will be 
 asked to provide a brief statement of motivation\, a very brief CV (one 
 paragraph)\, and indications of preferences for topics. <strong>Please 
 submit both forms\, persons who only apply through one of the two forms 
 will not be accepted</strong> to the school.</p> <p>For practical reasons 
 the school is organized to handle only a finite number of students in the 
 live sessions\, hence we must limit the number of officially registered 
 participants. Nevertheless\, the material and some forum channels will be 
 available at a later date also for those not officially admitted to the 
 school.</p> <p>The deadline for applications is the <strong>4th June 
 2021</strong>. We will communicate our acceptance decisions by the 11th 
 June. Accepted participants will be given access to the materials starting
  on the 21st June.</p> <h2>References</h2> <p>[1] José M Soler\, Emilio

DESCRIPTION:<p>This HLRS course addresses students\, data scientists\, and 
 researchers who would like to have an introduction to Machine and Deep 
 Learning methods to solve challenging and future-oriented problems. Both 
 Machine and Deep Learning methods and examples will be presented\, 
 together with their implementation on HLRS systems. The first part will be
  an introduction to basic methods in Machine Learning\, including pre-
 processing and supervised learning using Apache Spark. The course will 
 then move on to elements of supervised Deep Learning on real data to 
 classify annotated images of waste in the wild. Given the deluge of 
 information needed to power machine and deep learning methods\, it is 
 imperative to think about effective data processing strategies. 
 Therefore\, the course will conclude with an introduction to data 
 compression using the BigWhoop library (part of the <a 
 href="https://www.excellerat.eu/viewcode/9">EXCELLERAT Data Exchange and 
 Workflow Portal</a>). As an efficient data reduction tool\, BigWhoop can 
 be applied to generic numerical datasets to minimize I/O bottlenecks and 
 optimize data storage. The lectures are interleaved with many hands-on 
 sessions using Jupyter Notebooks and scripts on HLRS systems.</p>

SUMMARY:Advanced school on Quantum Transport using SIESTA
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1374
DESCRIPTION:<p>This five-day online school will focus on the field of 
 theoretical condensed matter electronic transport exploiting the non-
 equilibrium Green’s function approach. In particular\, recent advances in 
 transport theory [1] will be presented in the form of lectures and hands-
 on sessions on hot topics in the field. The teachers will present novel 
 methods used for materials research modelling. The participants will learn
  the advanced features of SIESTA [2]\, such as the calculations of non-
 equilibrium properties using the TranSIESTA/TBtrans approach and the 
 python framework SISL [3]. For example\, the school lectures will cover a 
 recent scheme introducing truly single-junction transport calculations [4]
  and the new implementations to include in the transport calculations 
 different corrections to the Hamiltonian accounting for electron-phonon 
 coupling [5]\, spin orbit coupling and electronic correlation. Moreover\, 
 the users will learn how to extract a tight-binding Hamiltonian from a DFT
  Hamiltonian allowing them to deal with very large systems [6\,7].</p> 
 <p>The lectures will take place via Zoom with an invited list of speakers 
 who will present their work in a variety of fields in which the covered 
 tools have been used. Each topic will be followed by a hands-on session 
 allowing participants first-hand experience with the tools and 
 analysis.</p> <p>While this is an open workshop (for everybody!)\, we ask 
 participants to sign-up due to content distribution prior to the workshop 
 itself.</p> <p>The workshop will also host 2 evenings with online poster 
 sessions\, and all participants are expected to present their research in 
 one of the two sessions.</p> <p><strong>The deadline for the abstract 
 submission is April 1 th.</strong></p> <p>For more details follow <a

  follow) and all material will be made available at <a 
 href="https://github.com/zerothi/ts-tbt-sisl-
 tutorial">https://github.com/zerothi/ts-tbt-sisl-tutorial</a></p> 
 <p><strong>Detailed School Topics:</strong></p> <p><em>Advanced usage of 
 SIESTA\, TranSIESTA/TBtrans and sisl</em></p> <p>Participants will learn 
 how to use the advanced features implemented in the aforementioned code 
 and python framework. In particular students will be taught how to perform
  efficient DFT+NEGF calculations\, pre-processing\, post-processing 
 analysis and data visualization.</p> <p><em>Electrochemistry</em></p> 
 <p>First principles simulations are now crucial in many areas of materials
  science. However\, this has not yet reached the field of 
 electrochemistry\, where the complexity of the electrochemical environment
  and the presence of the external electrode potential are difficulties 
 that have precluded direct application of the usual first-principles 
 methods like DFT. We will explain how some of these problems\, like the 
 presence of the electrostatic potential\, can be tackled using 
 TranSIESTA.</p> <p><em>Topological Insulators</em></p> <p>Topological 
 insulators (TI) are a phase of matter characterized by a bulk energy gap 
 and conducting surface (or edge) states symmetry-protected against small 
 perturbations. Quantum transport simulations are crucial to compute and 
 validate the topological properties of materials. We will show how SIESTA 
 can be used to predict the essential features of topological materials\, 
 leveraging on the recent Spin-Orbit Coupling implementation and SISL.</p> 
 <p><em>Inelastic transport</em></p> <p>The modelling of inelastic effects 
 due to the electron-phonon coupling in nano-scale devices is of great 
 technological importance as it impacts both the transport properties and 
 Joule heating. It is especially challenging to include the effects in 
 large-scale atomistic first principles device simulations. We will discuss
  how this can be addressed using various approximations and introduce the 
 Inelastica package (<a href="https://github.com/tfrederiksen/inelastica/">
 https://github.com/tfrederiksen/inelastica/</a>) based on TranSIESTA.</p> 
 <p><em>Correlated systems and the meanfield Hubbard model</em></p> 
 <p>Coulomb repulsion between electrons can lead to unpaired electron 
 states and interesting spin structures. For graphene-like nanostructures 
 the meanfield Hubbard model provides a simple and\, yet\, often sufficient
  method to understand how electronic interactions lead to magnetism. We 
 will describe an implementation of this model based on SISL.</p> 
 <p><em>Single contacts by removal of periodic images</em></p> 
 <p>Understanding transport properties under non-equilibrium is of vital 
 importance to the development of next-generation electronics. A basic 
 principle of conducting such simulations is by using Bloch’s theorem which
  has the disadvantage of adding a periodic image of the junction. We will 
 present how users can overcome this limitation and simulate truly single 
 junctions.</p> <p><em>Modelling of extremely large-systems with DFT 
 precision</em></p> <p>Recent increase in compute power is rapidly 
 decreasing the gap between experimental and theoretical works. This allows
  theoreticians to study one-to-one samples matching an exact experiment. 
 However\, there is still some way to go in terms of scalability and 
 precision. Here we present a method to extract the important part of a 
 Hamiltonian in an energy window allowing simulations of transport 
 properties of even larger systems by retaining the band-structure without 
 using any wannierization techniques.</p> <h2>References</h2> <p>[1] N.

SUMMARY:Workshop on High-performance Data Analytics @ENCCS/HiDALGO
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/869
DESCRIPTION:<h2>General description and learning outcomes</h2> <p>We would 
 like to invite you to participate in our High-performance data analytics 
 course where we will introduce different tools and methods for Big data 
 handling. The tools will be presented on two different use cases but can 
 be applied to any data.</p> <p>HiDALGO (<a href="https://hidalgo-
 project.eu/">https://hidalgo-project.eu/</a>) – HPC and Big Data 
 Technologies for Global Systems – is a European project funded by the 
 Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union. The project is 
 carried out by 13 institutions from seven countries. <br>  This training 
 event will start with an introductory talk to provide a view of high-
 performance data analytics (HPDA) from the HiDALGO perspective. The main 
 concepts will be presented\, listing the tools that have been used\, 
 together with information about benchmarks the consortium has done (as a 
 source of information about their scalability). This introduction also 
 presents how these tools are being applied in HiDALGO\, in order to solve 
 different problems.<br>  The following part of the training will focus on 
 HPC and HPDA technologies\, applied to use-cases such as Urban Air 
 Pollution (UAP). The UAP application is a software framework for modeling 
 the vehicular traffic emitted air pollution and its dispersion at very 
 high resolution by using geometry inputs (Open Street Map)\, coupled 
 weather data (ECMWF) and traffic simulation (SUMO)\, computational fluid 
 dynamics (CFD) tools running on HPC infrastructures (OpenFOAM)\, and 
 evaluation with HPDA methods.<br>  This HPC/HPDA/UAP-part of the training 
 will introduce the UAP concept\, workflows\, implementations\, application
  of the CFD-module in HPC environment\, deployment to HPC\, running\, and 
 evaluation. Participants will learn the techniques of these parts from a 
 general perspective\, namely\, HPC workflow modeling (TOSCA in YAML 
 rendering)\, basics of OpenFOAM for computation of air pollutant 
 dispersion using HPC\, and the applied HPDA methods for fast 
 evaluation.<br>  The last part will provide an introduction to the data 
 available at ECMWF and Copernicus\, and the APIs for retrieving the data\,
  followed by practical sessions on data exploration and manipulation. 
 After this web-seminar\, participants will be able to independently 
 discover weather\, climate\, and environmental data produced and hosted by
  ECMWF\, and also to retrieve and process these data using Python 
 libraries.</p> <h2>For whom is the workshop</h2> <p>Researchers\, 
 practitioners\, and developers who are interested in implementation of HPC
  workflows and HPDA. Environmental scientists that would like to apply 
 microscale models and exploit the strength of HPC easily.</p> <p>The part 
 provided by ECMWF is aimed in particular at researchers that would like to
  use weather\, climate\, or environmental data in their work.</p> 
 <h2>Prerequisites</h2> <ul> <li>Participants are expected to have some 
 basic knowledge about Big Data technologies (although not mandatory).</li>
  <li>Participants need to have basic knowledge of Linux CLI for the 
 developer parts of the UAP training. For the application side\, basic 
 environmental knowledge related to air pollution needed (although not 
 mandatory).</li> <li>For the part related to weather\, participants are

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:<!DOCTYPE HTML><HTML><BODY><h2>General 
 description and learning outcomes</h2> <p>We would like to invite you to 
 participate in our High-performance data analytics course where we will 
 introduce different tools and methods for Big data handling. The tools 
 will be presented on two different use cases but can be applied to any 
 data.</p> <p>HiDALGO (<a href="https://hidalgo-
 project.eu/">https://hidalgo-project.eu/</a>) – HPC and Big Data 
 Technologies for Global Systems – is a European project funded by the 
 Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union. The project is 
 carried out by 13 institutions from seven countries. <br>  This training 
 event will start with an introductory talk to provide a view of high-
 performance data analytics (HPDA) from the HiDALGO perspective. The main 
 concepts will be presented, listing the tools that have been used, 
 together with information about benchmarks the consortium has done (as a 
 source of information about their scalability). This introduction also 
 presents how these tools are being applied in HiDALGO, in order to solve 
 different problems.<br>  The following part of the training will focus on 
 HPC and HPDA technologies, applied to use-cases such as Urban Air 
 Pollution (UAP). The UAP application is a software framework for modeling 
 the vehicular traffic emitted air pollution and its dispersion at very 
 high resolution by using geometry inputs (Open Street Map), coupled 
 weather data (ECMWF) and traffic simulation (SUMO), computational fluid 
 dynamics (CFD) tools running on HPC infrastructures (OpenFOAM), and 
 evaluation with HPDA methods.<br>  This HPC/HPDA/UAP-part of the training 
 will introduce the UAP concept, workflows, implementations, application of
  the CFD-module in HPC environment, deployment to HPC, running, and 
 evaluation. Participants will learn the techniques of these parts from a 
 general perspective, namely, HPC workflow modeling (TOSCA in YAML 
 rendering), basics of OpenFOAM for computation of air pollutant dispersion
  using HPC, and the applied HPDA methods for fast evaluation.<br>  The 
 last part will provide an introduction to the data available at ECMWF and 
 Copernicus, and the APIs for retrieving the data, followed by practical 
 sessions on data exploration and manipulation. After this web-seminar, 
 participants will be able to independently discover weather, climate, and 
 environmental data produced and hosted by ECMWF, and also to retrieve and 
 process these data using Python libraries.</p> <h2>For whom is the 
 workshop</h2> <p>Researchers, practitioners, and developers who are 
 interested in implementation of HPC workflows and HPDA. Environmental 
 scientists that would like to apply microscale models and exploit the 
 strength of HPC easily.</p> <p>The part provided by ECMWF is aimed in 
 particular at researchers that would like to use weather, climate, or 
 environmental data in their work.</p> <h2>Prerequisites</h2> <ul> 
 <li>Participants are expected to have some basic knowledge about Big Data 
 technologies (although not mandatory).</li> <li>Participants need to have 
 basic knowledge of Linux CLI for the developer parts of the UAP training. 
 For the application side, basic environmental knowledge related to air 
 pollution needed (although not mandatory).</li> <li>For the part related 
 to weather, participants are expected to have basic Python knowledge and 
 be comfortable using Jupyter Notebooks. They will have the option to 
 either use the mybinder.org platform or work locally. The github 
 repository with the notebooks and a list of libraries will be provided 
 before the workshop.</li> </ul> <h2>Instructors</h2> <p><strong>Zoltán

SUMMARY:Reproducible Software Environments & Benchmarks with Ansible and 
 Spack: HiDALGO approach
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/868
DESCRIPTION:<p>A talk will be given by Sergiy Gogolenko at HLRS (HiDALGO 
 partner) on simplifying user software installation on versatile 
 clusters/testbeds\, as well as creating reproducible software environments
  and benchmarks with Spack and Ansible for HiDALGO and HLRS-SANE 
 teams.</p> <p>Abstract:<br>  In recent decades\, there is a tendency to 
 pay solid attention to reproducibility of experiments in science. In many 
 cases\, reproducibility becomes one of the corner-stone measures (or even 
 pre-requisite for publication) of the high quality research. In terms of 
 HPC\, reproducibility of benchmarks presumes exhaustive reports of the 
 hardware and software setup\, as well as an easy and consistent way to 
 replicate the software environment in use.<br>  Unfortunately\, the users 
 of HPC clusters and testbeds face with a number of obstacles on the way to
  prepare reproducible software environments. In particular\, each data 
 center provides its own subset of pre-installed software and has a set of 
 specific policies and restrictions (like lack of access to internet). 
 Moreover\, in order to reach better performance\, the end-user usually 
 must install the software from sources watching all its dependencies\, 
 which demands an unnecessarily high level of technical expertise. As a 
 results\, installation often becomes a tedious time-consuming process 
 discouraging people from taking care of software reproducibility 
 particularly and from HPC generally.<br>  Spack is a HPC-oriented package 
 manager\, which solves most of the above-mentioned problems if configured 
 correctly\, while Ansible addresses the issue of deploying and configuring
  Spack with off-line mirrors for the end-users. In addition\, Ansible and 
 Spack feature deep integration of YAML and JSON formats along with a high 
 extensibility via a wide range of builtin and external modules. It makes 
 these tools a perfect combination not only for automated fully-
 reproducible software installation\, but also for documenting hardware and
  software configurations along with the installation process uniformly in 
 a human readable format easy to post-process.<br>  The purpose of this 
 talk is largely to teach basics of configuring and using Spack for the 
 end-users of HPC systems\, as well as to introduce an Ansible+Spack 
 solution which we use for automated installation of the same software on a
  variety of clusters.<br>  Tentative agenda:<br>  - Introduction to Spack 
 and Ansible (5min)<br> - Spack from user prospective: basic usage 
 (10min)<br> - Configuring Spack (15 min)<br> - Deployment of Spack on 
 versatile hardware with Ansible (10min)<br> - Reproducible benchmarks and 
 their reporting with Ansible (10min)<br> - Reproducible benchmarks and

SUMMARY:All electron DFT with Fleur - a Hands-on Tutorial
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1371
DESCRIPTION:<p>The density-functional theory (DFT) in its various 
 incarnation provides the most practical framework to compute basic 
 electronic\, magnetic\, and structural properties of materials. Large 
 scale materials screening using DFT is believed to be a key factor in 
 future materials development. The full-potential linearized augmented 
 planewave (FLAPW) method has emerged as a robust and precise state-of-the-
 art technique with reasonable computational efficiency. It is widely 
 accepted as providing the reference solution. However\, the use and 
 application of DFT methods and of FLAPW in particular require a thorough 
 training where users meet developers of such methods.</p> <p>Hence this 
 tutorial focuses on training the participants in using our all-electron 
 FLAPW DFT code <a href="http://www.flapw.de/">FLEUR</a>. A special focus 
 will be on the usage of FLEUR within the AiiDA infrastructure to build 
 automatic work-flows applicable to materials screening applications.</p> 
 <p>The tutorial covers theoretical lectures to provide the necessary 
 methodological and physical background to professionally use the FLEUR 
 code family and enable the participants to benefit from the strengths of 
 the codes. Hands-on sessions are provided to get in touch with the codes 
 from a practical perspective.</p> <p>Our school will consist of lectures 
 covering three main areas:</p> <ul> <li>the underlying basic theory\,</li>
  <li>the installation and usage of FLEUR and its <a 
 href="http://www.aiida.net/">AiiDA</a> interface\,</li> <li>more 
 specialized topics relevant for typical FLEUR calculations.</li> </ul>

SUMMARY:ONLINE Numerical methods for Large Eddy Simulation
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/860
DESCRIPTION:<p>The <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> code is a 
 parallel code of fluid mechanics that solves compressible Navier-Stokes 
 equations for laminar and turbulent reactive flows\, in 2D and 3D\, on 
 unstructured and hybrid meshes\, with third order Taylor Galerkin schemes.
  The resolution of these equations is based on the Large Eddy Simulation 
 (or Large Eddy Simulation) approach. Reduced chemical kinetics according 
 to the Arrhenius law coupled to the TFLES model for sub-grid flame-
 turbulence interactions make possible to treat combustion phenomena. <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> can also 
 calculate two-phase flows using a Lagrangian or Eulerian solver. <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> applies to 
 aeronautical combustion chambers\, turbomachinery\, industrial furnaces 
 and safety issues\, it allows for example to evaluate polluting emissions 
 (CO\, NOx and soot)\, to treat thermo-acoustic instabilities or detonation
  phenomena. <a href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> 
 is a world-famous code in the field of combustion\, used by many 
 laboratories (IMFT in Toulouse\, EM2C in Centralesupelec\, TU Munich\, Von

  course is on modern iterative solvers for large linear systems of 
 equations. Thereby, beside classical schemes and fundamentals of multigrid
  techniques different modern Krylov subspace methods (CG, GMRES, BiCGSTAB 
 ...) as well as highly efficient preconditioning techniques are presented 
 in the context of real life applications. Hands-on sessions (MATLAB and 
 GNU Octave respectively) will allow users to immediately test and 
 understand the basic constructs of iterative solvers. This course provides
  scientific training in Computational Science, and in addition, the 
 scientific exchange of the participants among themselves. It is organized 
 by HLRS, IAG, and Uni. Kassel.</p> <p>The guest lecture on Day 2 is

SUMMARY:Extended Software Development Workshop in HPC for mesoscale 
 simulation
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/971
DESCRIPTION:<p>Mesoscale simulations have grown recently in importance due 
 to their capacity of capturing molecular and atomistic effects without 
 having to solve for a prohibitively large number of particles needed in 
 Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations. Different approaches\, emerging from a
  coarse approximation to a group of atoms and molecules\, allow 
 reproducing both chemical and physical main properties as well as 
 continuum behaviour such as the hydrodynamics of fluid flows.</p> <p>One 
 of the most common techniques is the Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD): 
 an approximate\, coarse-grain\, mesoscale simulation method for 
 investigating phenomena between the atomic and the continuum scale world\,
  like flows through complex geometries\, micro fluids\, phase behaviours 
 and polymer processing. It consists of an off-lattice\, discrete particle 
 method similar to MD but with replacement of a soft potential for the 
 conservative force\, a random force to simulate the Brownian motion of the
  particles and a drag force to balance the random force and conserve the 
 total momentum of the system.</p> <p>However\, real applications usually 
 consist of a large number of particles and despite the coarse grain 
 approximation\, compared to MD\, High Performance Computing (HPC) is often
  required for simulating systems of industrial and scientific interest. On
  the other hand\, today’s hardware is quickly moving towards hybrid CPU-
 GPU architectures. In fact\, five of the top ten supercomputer are made of
  mixed CPU and NVidia GPU accelerators which allow to achieve hundreds of 
 PetaFlops performance. This type of architecture is also one of the main 
 paths toward Exascale.</p> <p>Few software\, like DL_MESO\, userMESO and 
 LAMMPS\, can currently simulate large DPD simulations. In particular\, 
 DL_MESO has recently been ported to multi-GPU architectures and runs 
 efficiently up to 4096 GPUs. This allows investigating very large system 
 with billions of particles within affordable computational effort. 
 However\, additional effort is required to enable the current version to 
 cover more complex physics\, like long range forces as well as achieving 
 higher parallel computing efficiency.</p> <p>The purpose of this Extended 
 Software Development Workshop (ESDW) is to introduce students to the 
 parallel programming of hybrid CPU-GPU systems. The intention is not only 
 to port mesoscale solvers on GPUs\, but also to expose the community to 
 this new programming paradigm\, which they can benefit from in their own 
 fields of research. See more details about the topics covered by this ESDW

SUMMARY:Integration of ESL modules into electronic-structure codes
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1376
DESCRIPTION:<p>The evolutionary pressure on electronic structure software 
 development is greatly increasing\, due to the emergence of new 
 paradigms\, new kinds of users\, new processes\, and new tools. Electronic
  structure software complexity is consequently also increasing\, requiring
  a larger effort on code maintenance. Developers of large electronic 
 structure codes are trying to relieve some complexity by transitioning 
 standardized algorithms into separate libraries [BigDFT-PSolver\, ELPA\, 
 ELSI\, LibXC\, LibGridXC\, etc.]. This paradigm shift requires library 
 developers to have a hybrid developer profile where the scientific and 
 computational skill set becomes equally important. These topics have been 
 extensively and publicly discussed between developers of various projects 
 including ABINIT\, ASE\, ATK\, BigDFT\, CASTEP\, FHI-aims\, GPAW\, 
 Octopus\, Quantum Espresso\, SIESTA\, and SPR-KKR.</p> <p>High-quality 
 standardized libraries are not only a highly challenging effort lying at 
 the hands of the library developers\, they also open possibilities for 
 codes to take advantage of a standard way to access commonly used 
 algorithms. Integration of these libraries\, however\, requires a 
 significant initial effort that is often sacrificed for new developments 
 that often not even reach the mainstream branch of the code. 
 Additionally\, there are multiple challenges in adopting new libraries 
 which have their roots in a variety of issues: installation\, data 
 structures\, physical units and parallelism - all of which are code-
 dependent. On the other hand\, adoption of common libraries ensures the 
 immediate propagation of improvements within the respective library’s 
 field of research and ensures codes are up-to-date with much less effort 
 [LibXC]. Indeed\, well-established libraries can have a huge impact on 
 multiple scientific communities at once [PETSc].</p> <p>In the Electronic 
 Structure community\, two issues are emerging. Libraries are being 
 developed [esl\, esl-gitlab] but require an ongoing commitment from the 
 community with respect to sharing the maintenance and development effort. 
 Secondly\, existing codes will benefit from libraries by adopting their 
 use. Both issues are mainly governed by the exposure of the libraries and 
 the availability of library core developers\, which are typically 
 researchers pressured by publication deliverables and fund-raising 
 burdens. They are thus not able to commit a large fraction of their time 
 to software development.</p> <p>An effort to allow code developers to make
  use of\, and develop\, shared components is needed. This requires an 
 efficient coordination between various elements:</p> <p>A common and 
 consistent code development infrastructure/education in terms of 
 compilation\, installation\, testing and documentation.<br> - How to use 
 and integrate already published libraries into existing projects.<br> - 
 Creating long-lasting synergies between developers to reach a “critical 
 mass” of component contributors.<br> - Relevant quality metrics ("TRLs" 
 and “SRLs”)\, to provide businesses with useful information .</p> <p>This 
 is what the Electronic Structure Library (ESL)[esl\, esl-gitlab] has been 
 doing since 2014\, with a wiki\, a data-exchange standard\, refactoring 
 code of global interest into integrated modules\, and regularly organizing
  workshops\, within a wider movement lead by the European eXtreme Data and
  Computing Initiative [exdci].</p> <p>References</p> <p>[BigDFT-PSolver]

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:<!DOCTYPE HTML><HTML><BODY><p>The evolutionary
  pressure on electronic structure software development is greatly 
 increasing, due to the emergence of new paradigms, new kinds of users, new
  processes, and new tools. Electronic structure software complexity is 
 consequently also increasing, requiring a larger effort on code 
 maintenance. Developers of large electronic structure codes are trying to 
 relieve some complexity by transitioning standardized algorithms into 
 separate libraries [BigDFT-PSolver, ELPA, ELSI, LibXC, LibGridXC, etc.]. 
 This paradigm shift requires library developers to have a hybrid developer
  profile where the scientific and computational skill set becomes equally 
 important. These topics have been extensively and publicly discussed 
 between developers of various projects including ABINIT, ASE, ATK, BigDFT,
  CASTEP, FHI-aims, GPAW, Octopus, Quantum Espresso, SIESTA, and SPR-
 KKR.</p> <p>High-quality standardized libraries are not only a highly 
 challenging effort lying at the hands of the library developers, they also
  open possibilities for codes to take advantage of a standard way to 
 access commonly used algorithms. Integration of these libraries, however, 
 requires a significant initial effort that is often sacrificed for new 
 developments that often not even reach the mainstream branch of the code. 
 Additionally, there are multiple challenges in adopting new libraries 
 which have their roots in a variety of issues: installation, data 
 structures, physical units and parallelism - all of which are code-
 dependent. On the other hand, adoption of common libraries ensures the 
 immediate propagation of improvements within the respective library’s 
 field of research and ensures codes are up-to-date with much less effort 
 [LibXC]. Indeed, well-established libraries can have a huge impact on 
 multiple scientific communities at once [PETSc].</p> <p>In the Electronic 
 Structure community, two issues are emerging. Libraries are being 
 developed [esl, esl-gitlab] but require an ongoing commitment from the 
 community with respect to sharing the maintenance and development effort. 
 Secondly, existing codes will benefit from libraries by adopting their 
 use. Both issues are mainly governed by the exposure of the libraries and 
 the availability of library core developers, which are typically 
 researchers pressured by publication deliverables and fund-raising 
 burdens. They are thus not able to commit a large fraction of their time 
 to software development.</p> <p>An effort to allow code developers to make
  use of, and develop, shared components is needed. This requires an 
 efficient coordination between various elements:</p> <p>A common and 
 consistent code development infrastructure/education in terms of 
 compilation, installation, testing and documentation.<br> - How to use and
  integrate already published libraries into existing projects.<br> - 
 Creating long-lasting synergies between developers to reach a “critical 
 mass” of component contributors.<br> - Relevant quality metrics ("TRLs" 
 and “SRLs”), to provide businesses with useful information .</p> <p>This 
 is what the Electronic Structure Library (ESL)[esl, esl-gitlab] has been 
 doing since 2014, with a wiki, a data-exchange standard, refactoring code 
 of global interest into integrated modules, and regularly organizing 
 workshops, within a wider movement lead by the European eXtreme Data and 
 Computing Initiative [exdci].</p> <p>References</p> <p>[BigDFT-PSolver] <a
