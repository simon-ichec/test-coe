SUMMARY:ONLINE Numerical methods for Large Eddy Simulation
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1339
DESCRIPTION:<p>The <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> code is a 
 parallel code of fluid mechanics that solves compressible Navier-Stokes 
 equations for laminar and turbulent reactive flows\, in 2D and 3D\, on 
 unstructured and hybrid meshes\, with third order Taylor Galerkin schemes.
  The resolution of these equations is based on the Large Eddy Simulation 
 (or Large Eddy Simulation) approach. Reduced chemical kinetics according 
 to the Arrhenius law coupled to the TFLES model for sub-grid flame-
 turbulence interactions make possible to treat combustion phenomena. <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> can also 
 calculate two-phase flows using a Lagrangian or Eulerian solver. <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> applies to 
 aeronautical combustion chambers\, turbomachinery\, industrial furnaces 
 and safety issues\, it allows for example to evaluate polluting emissions 
 (CO\, NOx and soot)\, to treat thermo-acoustic instabilities or detonation
  phenomena. <a href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> 
 is a world-famous code in the field of combustion\, used by many 
 laboratories (IMFT in Toulouse\, EM2C in Centralesupelec\, TU Munich\, Von
  Karmann Institute\, ETH Zurich\, etc.) and in industry (SAFRAN AIRCRAFT 
 ENGINES\, SAFRAN HELICOPTER ENGINES\, ARIANEGROUP\, HERAKLES\, TOTAL\,

SUMMARY:ONLINE Training on Nek5000 @ENCCS/EXCELLERAT

DESCRIPTION:<p>In this one-day training\, we will give an overview of the 
 capabilities and features of Nek5000\, together with a hands-on session to
  install\, run and postprocess some comparably simple flow cases. Nek5000 
 is a spectral-element based solver for CFD\, and is available as an open 
 source package. The code has become popular among researchers worldwide\, 
 mainly because of its relatively high accuracy per grid point\, its 
 parallel efficiency and the wide user community and available packages 
 (e.g. statistics\, linear stability\, adjoints etc.).</p> <p>The 
 development of the various methods goes back to the mid 80s\, and a number
  of different approaches is now implemented\, both when it comes to the 
 integration of Navier-Stokes\, the communication kernels and efficient 
 single-core performance. There are also advanced capabilities when it 
 comes to meshing\, turbulence models\, moving meshes that make Nek5000 
 attractive even for more industrially relevant flows. The benefit of high 
 order and efficient parallelisation is clearly a distinguishing feature in
  situations when high fidelity simulation data is required.</p>

SUMMARY:ONLINE COURSE: From Machine Learning to Deep Learning: a concise 
 introduction
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/857
DESCRIPTION:<p>This HLRS course addresses students\, data scientists\, and 
 researchers who would like to have an introduction to Machine and Deep 
 Learning methods to solve challenging and future-oriented problems. Both 
 Machine and Deep Learning methods and examples will be presented\, 
 together with their implementation on HLRS systems. The first part will be
  an introduction to basic methods in Machine Learning\, including pre-
 processing and supervised learning using Apache Spark. The course will 
 then move on to elements of supervised Deep Learning on real data to 
 classify annotated images of waste in the wild. Given the deluge of 
 information needed to power machine and deep learning methods\, it is 
 imperative to think about effective data processing strategies. 
 Therefore\, the course will conclude with an introduction to data 
 compression using the BigWhoop library (part of the <a 
 href="https://www.excellerat.eu/viewcode/9">EXCELLERAT Data Exchange and 
 Workflow Portal</a>). As an efficient data reduction tool\, BigWhoop can 
 be applied to generic numerical datasets to minimize I/O bottlenecks and 
 optimize data storage. The lectures are interleaved with many hands-on 
 sessions using Jupyter Notebooks and scripts on HLRS systems.</p>

SUMMARY:Fortran for High Performance Computing
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/859
DESCRIPTION:<p>Despite its age\, Fortran remains the dominant programming 
 language for high performance computing. This webinar will discuss 
 language constructs that are pertinent to HPC such as coarrays\, do 
 concurrent\, and improved interoperability with C in the 2018 standard. 
 This webinar will also discuss GPU programming in CUDA and OpenACC as well
  as the MPI 2018 bindings that use derived data types. The webinar will 
 discuss recent attempts to revive Fortran and encourage the community to 
 be more involved in the future of the language via the <a 
 href="https://fortran-lang.org/">new website</a>.</p>

SUMMARY:ONLINE Numerical methods for Large Eddy Simulation
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/860
DESCRIPTION:<p>The <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> code is a 
 parallel code of fluid mechanics that solves compressible Navier-Stokes 
 equations for laminar and turbulent reactive flows\, in 2D and 3D\, on 
 unstructured and hybrid meshes\, with third order Taylor Galerkin schemes.
  The resolution of these equations is based on the Large Eddy Simulation 
 (or Large Eddy Simulation) approach. Reduced chemical kinetics according 
 to the Arrhenius law coupled to the TFLES model for sub-grid flame-
 turbulence interactions make possible to treat combustion phenomena. <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> can also 
 calculate two-phase flows using a Lagrangian or Eulerian solver. <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> applies to 
 aeronautical combustion chambers\, turbomachinery\, industrial furnaces 
 and safety issues\, it allows for example to evaluate polluting emissions 
 (CO\, NOx and soot)\, to treat thermo-acoustic instabilities or detonation
  phenomena. <a href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> 
 is a world-famous code in the field of combustion\, used by many 
 laboratories (IMFT in Toulouse\, EM2C in Centralesupelec\, TU Munich\, Von
  Karmann Institute\, ETH Zurich\, etc.) and in industry (SAFRAN AIRCRAFT 
 ENGINES\, SAFRAN HELICOPTER ENGINES\, ARIANEGROUP\, HERAKLES\, TOTAL\, 
 etc.).</p>

SUMMARY:Data analytics for engineering data using machine learning
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/861
DESCRIPTION:<p>As part of the EXCELLERAT training program\, <a 
 href="https://www.scai.fraunhofer.de">Fraunhofer SCAI</a> offers a 
 workshop on data analytics for engineering data using machine 
 learning.</p> <p>The workshop day consists of two parts:</p> <ol> <li> In 
 the morning part an introductory training on machine learning topics like 
 clustering and dimension reduction techniques is provided. Brief hands-on 
 exercises in python will aid the understanding of the material. </li> <li>
  The second part will take place in the afternoon and will specifically 
 deal with applying the machine learning methods from the first part to 
 numerical simulation data stemming from engineering tasks. The SCAI 
 DataViewer will assist the participants in analysing the provided 
 simulation data sets. </li> </ol> <p>This first instance of this workshop 
 will be open for all partners and corresponding institutes of 
 EXCELLERAT.</p>
