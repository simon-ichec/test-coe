DESCRIPTION:<p>In this one-day training\, we will give an overview of the 
 capabilities and features of Nek5000\, together with a hands-on session to
  install\, run and postprocess some comparably simple flow cases. Nek5000 
 is a spectral-element based solver for CFD\, and is available as an open 
 source package. The code has become popular among researchers worldwide\, 
 mainly because of its relatively high accuracy per grid point\, its 
 parallel efficiency and the wide user community and available packages 
 (e.g. statistics\, linear stability\, adjoints etc.).</p> <p>The 
 development of the various methods goes back to the mid 80s\, and a number
  of different approaches is now implemented\, both when it comes to the 
 integration of Navier-Stokes\, the communication kernels and efficient 
 single-core performance. There are also advanced capabilities when it 
 comes to meshing\, turbulence models\, moving meshes that make Nek5000 
 attractive even for more industrially relevant flows. The benefit of high 
 order and efficient parallelisation is clearly a distinguishing feature in
  situations when high fidelity simulation data is required.</p>

SUMMARY:Workshop on High-performance Data Analytics @ENCCS/HiDALGO
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/869
DESCRIPTION:<h2>General description and learning outcomes</h2> <p>We would 
 like to invite you to participate in our High-performance data analytics 
 course where we will introduce different tools and methods for Big data 
 handling. The tools will be presented on two different use cases but can 
 be applied to any data.</p> <p>HiDALGO (<a href="https://hidalgo-
 project.eu/">https://hidalgo-project.eu/</a>) – HPC and Big Data 
 Technologies for Global Systems – is a European project funded by the 
 Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union. The project is 
 carried out by 13 institutions from seven countries. <br>  This training 
 event will start with an introductory talk to provide a view of high-
 performance data analytics (HPDA) from the HiDALGO perspective. The main 
 concepts will be presented\, listing the tools that have been used\, 
 together with information about benchmarks the consortium has done (as a 
 source of information about their scalability). This introduction also 
 presents how these tools are being applied in HiDALGO\, in order to solve 
 different problems.<br>  The following part of the training will focus on 
 HPC and HPDA technologies\, applied to use-cases such as Urban Air 
 Pollution (UAP). The UAP application is a software framework for modeling 
 the vehicular traffic emitted air pollution and its dispersion at very 
 high resolution by using geometry inputs (Open Street Map)\, coupled 
 weather data (ECMWF) and traffic simulation (SUMO)\, computational fluid 
 dynamics (CFD) tools running on HPC infrastructures (OpenFOAM)\, and 
 evaluation with HPDA methods.<br>  This HPC/HPDA/UAP-part of the training 
 will introduce the UAP concept\, workflows\, implementations\, application
  of the CFD-module in HPC environment\, deployment to HPC\, running\, and 
 evaluation. Participants will learn the techniques of these parts from a 
 general perspective\, namely\, HPC workflow modeling (TOSCA in YAML 
 rendering)\, basics of OpenFOAM for computation of air pollutant 
 dispersion using HPC\, and the applied HPDA methods for fast 
 evaluation.<br>  The last part will provide an introduction to the data 
 available at ECMWF and Copernicus\, and the APIs for retrieving the data\,
  followed by practical sessions on data exploration and manipulation. 
 After this web-seminar\, participants will be able to independently 
 discover weather\, climate\, and environmental data produced and hosted by
  ECMWF\, and also to retrieve and process these data using Python 
 libraries.</p> <h2>For whom is the workshop</h2> <p>Researchers\, 
 practitioners\, and developers who are interested in implementation of HPC
  workflows and HPDA. Environmental scientists that would like to apply 
 microscale models and exploit the strength of HPC easily.</p> <p>The part 
 provided by ECMWF is aimed in particular at researchers that would like to
  use weather\, climate\, or environmental data in their work.</p> 
 <h2>Prerequisites</h2> <ul> <li>Participants are expected to have some 
 basic knowledge about Big Data technologies (although not mandatory).</li>
  <li>Participants need to have basic knowledge of Linux CLI for the 
 developer parts of the UAP training. For the application side\, basic 
 environmental knowledge related to air pollution needed (although not 
 mandatory).</li> <li>For the part related to weather\, participants are 
 expected to have basic Python knowledge and be comfortable using Jupyter 
 Notebooks. They will have the option to either use the mybinder.org 
 platform or work locally. The github repository with the notebooks and a 
 list of libraries will be provided before the workshop.</li> </ul>

SUMMARY:QM/MM with GROMACS + CP2K
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1458
DESCRIPTION:<p><strong>Learning outcomes</strong><br> This course will 
 equip participants to perform hybrid QM/MM simulations using the molecular
  dynamics code GROMACS in combination with the quantum chemistry package 
 CP2K through an interface developed by one of the instructors from the 
 BioExcel Centre of Excellence (www.bioexcel.eu).</p> 
 <p><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br> Participants should be familiar with
  using GROMACS to perform molecular dynamics simulations. A background in 
 computational quantum chemistry is not strictly required since an 
 introduction of key aspects will be provided\, but previous familiarity is
  beneficial. You should be familiar with connecting to a remote machine 
 using ssh and will benefit from experience using an HPC facility as you 
 will execute hands-on practicals on the UK supercomputer ARCHER2.</p> 
 <p><strong>Description</strong><br> Most classical molecular mechanics 
 (MM) force fields are not sufficiently flexible to model processes in 
 which chemical bonds are broken or formed. Instead\, some level of quantum
  mechanical (QM) description is needed to gain detailed mechanistic 
 insights into reaction mechanisms\, e.g. the catalytic action of enzymes\,
  and to compute photochemical properties such as absorption and emission 
 spectra of fluorescent proteins. However biochemical systems (including 
 solvent) are too large to be solved in their entirety at ab initio QM 
 level or efficiently even with a high-quality density functional theory 
 (DFT) approximation. To overcome the cost of a QM description on the one 
 hand versus the limitations of a MM treatment on the other hand\, methods 
 have been developed that treat a small critical region of interest at QM 
 level while retaining the computationally cheaper MM force field for the 
 majority of the system.</p> <p>Despite the simplicity of the QM/MM 
 concept\, its application is currently restricted to a relatively small 
 group of specialised expert users often using in-house codes. To unlock 
 the power of QM/MM simulations for the wider biomolecular simulation 
 community\, the BioExcel Centre of Excellence has developed an interface 
 between the molecular dynamics code GROMACS\, which is widely used in the 
 biomolecular simulation community\, and the quantum chemistry package 
 CP2K\, which supports calculations under periodic boundary conditions with
  DFT methods.</p> <p>This course explains key aspects relating to the use 
 of QM/MM for biomolecular simulation with these two codes and equips 
 participants with the ability to start using GROMACS and CP2K for this 
 purpose in their own research. Participants are provided with the 
 opportunity to gain hands-on practical experience running several example 
 calculations on ARCHER2\, the UK national supercomputing service.</p>

 developed by one of the instructors from the BioExcel Centre of Excellence
  (www.bioexcel.eu).</p> <p><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br> Participants
  should be familiar with using GROMACS to perform molecular dynamics 
 simulations. A background in computational quantum chemistry is not 
 strictly required since an introduction of key aspects will be provided, 
 but previous familiarity is beneficial. You should be familiar with 
 connecting to a remote machine using ssh and will benefit from experience 
 using an HPC facility as you will execute hands-on practicals on the UK 
 supercomputer ARCHER2.</p> <p><strong>Description</strong><br> Most 
 classical molecular mechanics (MM) force fields are not sufficiently 
 flexible to model processes in which chemical bonds are broken or formed. 
 Instead, some level of quantum mechanical (QM) description is needed to 
 gain detailed mechanistic insights into reaction mechanisms, e.g. the 
 catalytic action of enzymes, and to compute photochemical properties such 
 as absorption and emission spectra of fluorescent proteins. However 
 biochemical systems (including solvent) are too large to be solved in 
 their entirety at ab initio QM level or efficiently even with a high-
 quality density functional theory (DFT) approximation. To overcome the 
 cost of a QM description on the one hand versus the limitations of a MM 
 treatment on the other hand, methods have been developed that treat a 
 small critical region of interest at QM level while retaining the 
 computationally cheaper MM force field for the majority of the system.</p>
  <p>Despite the simplicity of the QM/MM concept, its application is 
 currently restricted to a relatively small group of specialised expert 
 users often using in-house codes. To unlock the power of QM/MM simulations
  for the wider biomolecular simulation community, the BioExcel Centre of 
 Excellence has developed an interface between the molecular dynamics code 
 GROMACS, which is widely used in the biomolecular simulation community, 
 and the quantum chemistry package CP2K, which supports calculations under 
 periodic boundary conditions with DFT methods.</p> <p>This course explains
  key aspects relating to the use of QM/MM for biomolecular simulation with
  these two codes and equips participants with the ability to start using 
 GROMACS and CP2K for this purpose in their own research. Participants are 
 provided with the opportunity to gain hands-on practical experience 
 running several example calculations on ARCHER2, the UK national 
 supercomputing service.</p></BODY></HTML>

SUMMARY:Practical introduction to QM/MM using CP2K for biomolecular 
 modelling
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1463
DESCRIPTION:<p>As a collaboration between ARCHER2 Training and BioExcel\, 
 this free online course consists of interactive hands-on practical 
 sessions presented remotely using Collaborate. Attendees will be given 
 access to ARCHER to execute the practical.</p> <p>The course will run over
  two Tuesday afternoons\, 13th and 20th October. Participants are expected
  to attend both sessions. Each session will run from 13:30-16:00 with a 
 break 14:30-15:00. There will be a follow-up consultancy session\, where 
 you can drop-in to ask questions of the tutor on Tuesday 3rd November 
 14:00-16:00</p> <h3>Outline</h3> <p>CP2K is a quantum chemistry and solid 
 state physics software package that can perform atomistic simulations of a
  wide variety of systems\, ranging from solid state to biological systems.
  CP2K provides a general framework for running density functional theory 
 (DFT) simulations\, with extensions that enable users to run classical 
 molecular dynamics (MD)\, mix MD and DFT to obtain quantum-
 mechanical/molecular-dynamics (QM/MM) runs\, or perform other forms of 
 metadynamics\, Monte Carlo\, or other simulations.</p> <p>This course is 
 aiming to teach attendees how to prepare and run biochemical simulations 
 in CP2K. Specifically\, we will be looking at how CP2K can be used to 
 track the reaction dynamics of a system undergoing biological catalysis. 
 In this course\, we shall be focusing on a Diels Alder transition taking 
 place in an immunoglobulin. We will begin by considering the reaction site
  in a purely quantum-mechanical method. Then\, we will slowly increase the
  complexity of the system to take into account the entire structure of the
  immunoglobulin (using QM/MM approach)\, the solution\, and finally\, we 
 will add a ligand to the reaction.</p> <p>While we will be referencing 
 some DFT and QM/MM theory (mainly the nudged elastic band method and 
 metadynamics)\, this is not the principal aim of this course. Our aim is 
 to use these systems to help familiarise attendees with using CP2K to run 
 simulations of biochemical systems. CP2K can be used for non-biological 
 systems\, and the topics being taught here can be ported to other fields\,
  but this will not be a primary focus of this course.</p> <h3>Learning 
 outcomes</h3> <p>At the end of this session\, you will be able to:</p> 
 <ul> <li>Run a geometry optimisation using CP2K</li> <li>Run a frequency 
 calculation using CP2K</li> <li>Estimate the energy barrier of a chemical 
 reaction</li> <li>Run a nudged elastic band (NEB) simulation to fine-tune 
 the energy barrier and profile of a chemical reaction</li> <li>Prepare a 
 QM/MM simulation for CP2K</li> <li>Run a QM/MM simulation in CP2K</li>

UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1482
DESCRIPTION:<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p> <p>This course focuses on

 and tsunamis. The objective is to give a succinct theoretical overview and
  then introduce students on the use of different HPC flagship codes 
 included in the Center of Excellence for Exascale in Solid Earth (ChEESE).
  ASHEE is a volcanic plume and PDC simulator based on a multiphase fluid 
 dynamic model conceived for compressible mixtures composed of gaseous 
 components and solid particle phases. FALL3D is a Eulerian model for the 
 atmospheric transport and ground deposition of volcanic tephra (ash) used 
 in operational volcanic ash dispersal forecasts routinely used to prevent 
 aircraft encounters with volcanic ash clouds and to perform re-routings 
 avoiding contaminated airspace areas. T-HySEA solves the 2D shallow water 
 equations on hydrostatic and dispersive versions. Based on a high-order 
 Finite Volume (FV) discretisation (hydrostatic) with Finite Differences 
 (FD) for the dispersive version on two-way structured nested meshes in 
 spherical coordinates. Together with hands-on sessions\, the course will 
 also tackle post-process strategies based on python. In recent years\, the
  Python programming language has become one of the most popular choice for
  geoscientists. Python is a modern\, interpreted\, object-oriented\, open-
 source language easy to learn\, easy to read\, and fast to write. The 
 proliferation of multiple open-source projects with libraries available 
 every day\, have facilitated a rapid scientific development in the 
 geoscience community. In addition\, the modern data structures and object-
 oriented nature of the language along with an elegant syntax\, enable 
 Earth scientists to write more robust and less buggy code.</p> 
 <p><strong>Requirements</strong></p> <p>-At least University degree in 
 progress on Earth Sciences\, Computer Sciences or related area.<br> -Basic
  knowledge of LINUX<br> -Knowledge of C\, FORTRAN\, MPI or openMP is 
 recommended<br> -Knowledge of Earth Sciences data formats is recommended 
 (grib\, netcdf\, hdf\,...)<br> -Basic knowledge of python</p> 
 <p><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></p> <p>Participants will learn and
