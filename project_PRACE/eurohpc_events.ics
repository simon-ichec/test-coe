SUMMARY:Parallel Programming Workshop (MPI\, OpenMP and advanced topics) @ 
 HLRS
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/807
DESCRIPTION:<p><strong>Distributed memory parallelization with the Message 
 Passing Interface MPI (Mon\, for beginners):</strong></p> <p>On clusters 
 and distributed memory architectures\, parallel programming with the 
 Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the dominating programming model. The 
 course gives an introduction into MPI-1. Hands-on sessions (in C and 
 Fortran) will allow users to immediately test and understand the basic 
 constructs of the Message Passing Interface (MPI).</p> <p><strong>Shared 
 memory parallelization with OpenMP (Tue\, for beginners):</strong><br> The
  focus is on shared memory parallelization with OpenMP\, the key concept 
 on hyper-threading\, dual-core\, multi-core\, shared memory\, and ccNUMA 
 platforms. This course teaches shared memory OpenMP parallelization. 
 Hands-on sessions (in C and Fortran) will allow users to immediately test 
 and understand the directives and other interfaces of OpenMP. Race-
 condition debugging tools are also presented.</p> <p><strong>Intermediate 
 and advanced topics in parallel programming (Wed-Fri):</strong><br> Topics
  are advanced usage of communicators and virtual topologies\, one-sided 
 communication\, derived datatypes\, MPI-2 parallel file I/O\, hybrid mixed
  model MPI+OpenMP parallelization\, parallelization of explicit and 
 implicit solvers and of particle based applications\, parallel numerics 
 and libraries\, and parallelization with PETSc. MPI-3.0 introduced a new 
 shared memory programming interface\, which can be combined with MPI 
 message passing and remote memory access on the cluster interconnect. It 
 can be used for direct neighbor accesses similar to OpenMP or for direct 
 halo copies\, and enables new hybrid programming models. These models are 
 compared in the hybrid mixed model MPI+OpenMP parallelization session with
  various hybrid MPI+OpenMP approaches and pure MPI. Further aspects are 
 domain decomposition\, load balancing\, and debugging. Hands-on sessions 
 are included on all days. This course provides scientific training in 
 Computational Science\, and in addition\, the scientific exchange of the 
 participants among themselves.</p> <p><strong>Hands-on sessions</strong>

SUMMARY:ONLINE Training on Nek5000 @ENCCS/EXCELLERAT
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/856
DESCRIPTION:<p>In this one-day training\, we will give an overview of the 
 capabilities and features of Nek5000\, together with a hands-on session to
  install\, run and postprocess some comparably simple flow cases. Nek5000 
 is a spectral-element based solver for CFD\, and is available as an open 
 source package. The code has become popular among researchers worldwide\, 
 mainly because of its relatively high accuracy per grid point\, its 
 parallel efficiency and the wide user community and available packages 
 (e.g. statistics\, linear stability\, adjoints etc.).</p> <p>The 
 development of the various methods goes back to the mid 80s\, and a number
  of different approaches is now implemented\, both when it comes to the 
 integration of Navier-Stokes\, the communication kernels and efficient 
 single-core performance. There are also advanced capabilities when it 
 comes to meshing\, turbulence models\, moving meshes that make Nek5000 
 attractive even for more industrially relevant flows. The benefit of high 
 order and efficient parallelisation is clearly a distinguishing feature in
  situations when high fidelity simulation data is required.</p>

SUMMARY:Workshop on High-performance Data Analytics @ENCCS/HiDALGO
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/869
DESCRIPTION:<h2>General description and learning outcomes</h2> <p>We would 
 like to invite you to participate in our High-performance data analytics 
 course where we will introduce different tools and methods for Big data 
 handling. The tools will be presented on two different use cases but can 
 be applied to any data.</p> <p>HiDALGO (<a href="https://hidalgo-
 project.eu/">https://hidalgo-project.eu/</a>) – HPC and Big Data 
 Technologies for Global Systems – is a European project funded by the 
 Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union. The project is 
 carried out by 13 institutions from seven countries. <br>  This training 
 event will start with an introductory talk to provide a view of high-
 performance data analytics (HPDA) from the HiDALGO perspective. The main 
 concepts will be presented\, listing the tools that have been used\, 
 together with information about benchmarks the consortium has done (as a 
 source of information about their scalability). This introduction also 
 presents how these tools are being applied in HiDALGO\, in order to solve 
 different problems.<br>  The following part of the training will focus on 
 HPC and HPDA technologies\, applied to use-cases such as Urban Air 
 Pollution (UAP). The UAP application is a software framework for modeling 
 the vehicular traffic emitted air pollution and its dispersion at very 
 high resolution by using geometry inputs (Open Street Map)\, coupled 
 weather data (ECMWF) and traffic simulation (SUMO)\, computational fluid 
 dynamics (CFD) tools running on HPC infrastructures (OpenFOAM)\, and 
 evaluation with HPDA methods.<br>  This HPC/HPDA/UAP-part of the training 
 will introduce the UAP concept\, workflows\, implementations\, application
  of the CFD-module in HPC environment\, deployment to HPC\, running\, and 
 evaluation. Participants will learn the techniques of these parts from a 
 general perspective\, namely\, HPC workflow modeling (TOSCA in YAML 
 rendering)\, basics of OpenFOAM for computation of air pollutant 
 dispersion using HPC\, and the applied HPDA methods for fast 
 evaluation.<br>  The last part will provide an introduction to the data 
 available at ECMWF and Copernicus\, and the APIs for retrieving the data\,
  followed by practical sessions on data exploration and manipulation. 
 After this web-seminar\, participants will be able to independently 
 discover weather\, climate\, and environmental data produced and hosted by
  ECMWF\, and also to retrieve and process these data using Python 
 libraries.</p> <h2>For whom is the workshop</h2> <p>Researchers\, 
 practitioners\, and developers who are interested in implementation of HPC
  workflows and HPDA. Environmental scientists that would like to apply 
 microscale models and exploit the strength of HPC easily.</p> <p>The part 
 provided by ECMWF is aimed in particular at researchers that would like to
  use weather\, climate\, or environmental data in their work.</p> 
 <h2>Prerequisites</h2> <ul> <li>Participants are expected to have some 
 basic knowledge about Big Data technologies (although not mandatory).</li>
  <li>Participants need to have basic knowledge of Linux CLI for the 
 developer parts of the UAP training. For the application side\, basic 
 environmental knowledge related to air pollution needed (although not 
 mandatory).</li> <li>For the part related to weather\, participants are 
 expected to have basic Python knowledge and be comfortable using Jupyter 
 Notebooks. They will have the option to either use the mybinder.org 
 platform or work locally. The github repository with the notebooks and a 
 list of libraries will be provided before the workshop.</li> </ul>
