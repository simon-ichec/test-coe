SUMMARY:AI4EU WebCafe: Opportunities and Challenges of CoEs in the sector 
 of AI
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/812
DESCRIPTION:<p>The following session aims to bring together the Centers of 
 Excellence in AI sectors to discuss about the opportunities and challenges
  in the sector\, how the Centres of Excellence can help to tackle them 
 thanks to HPC technologies and which opportunities are emerging. It is a 
 good opportunity to get a common understanding of the ongoing activities 
 within the different CoEs and foster collaboration opportunities.</p>

SUMMARY:Massively Parallel GPU Computing with CUDA: Introduction
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1230
DESCRIPTION:<p>The training course covers the theoretical and practical 
 principles of massively parallel GPU computing with CUDA technology based 
 on hands-on exercises\, highlighting the capabilities of the parallel 
 computing on the way with increasing complexity. The course will discuss 
 the CUDA hardware and software architecture\, memory management\, parallel
  computing with C/C++ and Python\, common application libraries and tools.
  An additional attention is paid to the possibilities and advantages of 
 using CUDA in machine learning solutions.</p>
