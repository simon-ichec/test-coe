SUMMARY:Training on High Performance Data Analytics and Visualisation
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1414
DESCRIPTION:<p>As the volumes of weather and climate data expand\, it is of
  paramount importance for scientists to exploit techniques and solutions 
 able to efficiently extract knowledge from these data. </p> <p>This online
  training course aims to increase scientists’ expertise on data analysis 
 and visualisation applied to climate and weather domains\, using high-
 performance data analytics (HPDA) and visualisation tools available from 
 the open source market (i.e.\, Ophidia and ParaView). </p> <p>The training
  covers topics from simple analytics tasks to workflows and applications 
 (e.g.\, Python-based) and provides best practices and guidelines on 
 dealing with massive scientific datasets on HPC architectures. </p> 
 <p>Examples of real applications of the tools for data analytics and 
 visualisation (i.e.\, Ophidia and ParaView) in the climate and weather 
 domain will be presented. The training will include demos and hands-on 
 sessions concerning the different tools. </p> <p>This course is organised 
 in the context of the “Centre of Excellence in Simulation of Weather and 
 Climate in Europe” (ESiWACE) phase 2 project.</p> <p><strong>List of 
 Topics</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Introduction to big data\, scientific data 
 management and analytics at scale</li> <li>Open-source High Performance 
 Data Analytics (HPDA) tools</li> <li>Data Analytics workflows for 
 eScience</li> <li>Introduction to data visualisation using ParaView</li> 
 <li>Discussion of visualisation workflows\, from post to in-situ</li> 
 </ul> <p><strong>Audience</strong>: The training targets the audience in 
 the field of weather and climate research with different backgrounds\, 
 from computer to Earth system scientists. This course is open to 
 students\, young scientists and also more experienced 
 researchers/engineers who wish to improve their data analytics and 
 visualisation skills. Basic knowledge of Python\, Linux\, NetCDF data 
 format and general aspects concerning climate/weather data is required to 
 fully take advantage of the training.</p> <p><strong>Schedule</strong>: 
 The training is organised as an 8-hour online course\, divided into 4 
 sessions\, with 2 hours of work per day required for the participants. The
  event is scheduled for September 6-9\, 2022 according to the following 
 calendar:</p> <ul> <li>Session 1: Introduction to Ophidia\, 6th September 
 2022\, 14.30-16.30</li> <li>Session 2: Ophidia advanced concepts\, 7th 
 September 2022\, 14.30-16.30</li> <li>Session 3: Introduction to 
 ParaView\, 8th September 2022\, 14.30-16.30</li> <li>Session 4: Advanced 
 ParaView use\, 9th September 2022\, 14.30-16.30</li> </ul> <p>Each session
  combines presentations about the various topics and practical 
 tutorials/hands-on.</p> <p><strong>Participation</strong>: Registration is
  required for attending the online live training sessions. The training 
 materials (e.g.\, slides\, instructions\, notebooks\, scripts\, etc.) will
  be made available. Instructions and materials for the practical sessions 
 will be made available beforehand to registered users.</p> <p><strong>You

SUMMARY:Tackling global challenges by use of HPC / HPDA and AI Workshop at 
 the HiPEAC Conference
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/974
DESCRIPTION:<p>Global challenges\, like the spread of diseases\, climate 
 change\, air pollution\, forced migration\, the spread of disinformation 
 in social networks and the sustainable use of energy are more emergent and
  urgent than ever. The use of HPC\, HPDA and Artificial Intelligence 
 allows to accurately model and simulate the underlying complex 
 processes.</p> <p>Within this workshop several current examples are 
 presented of how HPC\, HPDA and AI support the tackling of global 
 challenges. The workshop provides insights into advanced HPC\, HPDA and AI
  technologies to improve data-centric computation. It aims to attract and 
 bring together different stakeholders from the HPC and Big Data and Global
  Challenges communities.</p>
