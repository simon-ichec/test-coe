SUMMARY:[ONLINE] PATC: Introduction to HPC for Life Scientists
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1003
DESCRIPTION:<p>This course introduces HPC to life science researchers\, 
 focusing on the aspects that are most important for those new to this 
 technology to understand. It will help you judge how HPC can best benefit 
 your research\, and equip you to go on to successfully and efficiently 
 make use of HPC facilities in future. The course will cover basic concepts
  in HPC hardware\, software\, user environments\, filesystems\, and 
 programming models. It also provides an opportunity to gain hands-on 
 practical experience and assistance using an HPC system (MARENOSTRUM) 
 through examples drawn from the life sciences\, such as biomolecular 
 simulation.</p>
