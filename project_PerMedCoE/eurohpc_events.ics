SUMMARY:[ONLINE] PATC: Introduction to HPC for Life Scientists
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1003
DESCRIPTION:<p>This course introduces HPC to life science researchers\, 
 focusing on the aspects that are most important for those new to this 
 technology to understand. It will help you judge how HPC can best benefit 
 your research\, and equip you to go on to successfully and efficiently 
 make use of HPC facilities in future. The course will cover basic concepts
  in HPC hardware\, software\, user environments\, filesystems\, and 
 programming models. It also provides an opportunity to gain hands-on 
 practical experience and assistance using an HPC system (MARENOSTRUM) 
 through examples drawn from the life sciences\, such as biomolecular 
 simulation.</p>

SUMMARY:Short course on HPC-based Computational Bio-Medicine
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1483
DESCRIPTION:<p><strong>Objectives:</strong>The objetive of this course is 
 to give a panorama on the use of HPC-based computational mechanics in 
 Engineering and Environment through the projects BSC are carrying on. This
  panorama includes the basics of what is behind the main tools: 
 computational mechanics and parallelization. The training is delivered in 
 collaboration with the center of excellence CompBioMed.</p> 
 <p><strong>Learning outcomes: </strong>The course gives a wide perspective
  and the latest trends of how HPC helps in industrial\, clinical and 
 research applications allowing to achieve more realistic multiphysics 
 simulations. In addition\, the student has the opportunity of running Jobs
  in Marenostrum supercomputer.</p> <p><strong>Level: 
 </strong>INTERMEDIATE: For trainees with some theoretical and practical 
 knowledge</p>
