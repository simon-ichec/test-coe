SUMMARY:YALES2 Training Session
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1322
DESCRIPTION:<p>YALES2 aims at the solving of two-phase combustion from 
 primary atomization to pollutant prediction on massive complex meshes. It 
 is able to handle efficiently unstructured meshes with several billions of
  elements\, thus enabling the Direct Numerical Simulation and Large-Eddy 
 Simulation of laboratory and semi-industrial configurations. The recent 
 developments are focused on the dynamic mesh adaptation of tetrahedral-
 based massive meshes for fronts and interfaces.</p> <p>This training 
 session targets researchers and engineers interested in learning YALES2 
 and/or the numerical methodologies developed in YALES2: solving for 
 incompressible turbulent flows\, two-phase flows\, dynamic mesh 
 adaptation\, etc.</p> <p>More information about YALES2 can be found 
 <strong><a href="https://www.coria-
 cfd.fr/index.php/YALES2">here</a></strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Instructors:</strong> Vincent Moureau (CNRS)\, Ghislain 
 Lartigue (CNRS)\, Pierre Bénard (INSA of Rouen)</p>

SUMMARY:South-East Europe Combustion Spring School 2022
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1324
DESCRIPTION:<p>South-East Europe Combustion Spring School 2022 intends to 
 give a high view of fundamental aspects and current challenges in 
 combustion\, as well as to introduce the use of Machine Learning (ML) and 
 High Performance Computing (HPC) to approach Exa-scale simulations of 
 turbulent reacting flows. In this course\, different methodologies to 
 enhance the computational performance of high-fidelity combustion 
 simulations will be introduced. The methods cover from node to system-
 level performance optimisations and algorithms for combustion simulations.
  This is the first training course in a series of two CoEC seasonal 
 schools that will take place in 2022. This introductory school to 
 combustion will allow participants to acquire new knowledge and strengthen
  their understanding in a range of topics including laminar flames\, 
 turbulent combustion\, ML and HPC methodologies in combustion and 
 interactive supercomputing for in-situ analysis. In the following up CoEC 
 School for 2022\, we will build on the ground of the first school by 
 extending the scope and topics covered and by including a number of hands-
 on exercises.</p> <p><strong>The CoEC Spring School 2022 is a joint effort
  by </strong><a href="https://www.ncsa.bg/">NCSA Bulgaria</a><strong>\,
