SUMMARY:Co-Design for HPC in Computational Materials and Molecular Science
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1443
DESCRIPTION:<p>The Workshop on HPC (High Performance Computing) Co-design 
 in Computational Materials and Molecular Science was initiated and is led 
 by the NOMAD Center of Excellence (www.nomad-coe.eu)\, and is organised by
  NOMAD in collaboration with the BioExcel\, MAX\, and TREX CoEs. </p> 
 <p>The workshop will gather contributions from leading scientists\, 
 technologies\, and SW engineers from the fields of academia\, HPC 
 centres\, HW-vendors\, and industry. The workshop covers a broad range of 
 current topics\, taking materials and molecular science codes as reference
  HPC applications and possible co-design vehicles. </p> <p>The topics to 
 be covered are:</p> <p>(1) existing examples of HPC co-design in materials
  and molecular science\,</p> <p>(2) co-design of general purpose and 
 domain-specific libraries\, kernels\, and mini-apps\, and</p> <p>(3) the 
 perspective of hardware manufacturers\, integrators\, and data center 
 owners.</p> <p>The workshop will focus in particular on\, and attempt to 
 draw conclusions about:</p> <p>(1) the relationship between algorithms and
  computer architectures in materials science\,</p> <p>(2) the connection 
 between parallel programming technologies and runtime systems\, and</p> 
 <p>(3) the interplay of the above layers for a wide spectrum of computer 
 architectures\, within the selected scientific domain. </p> <p>We aim to 
 identify how scientific software developers in materials science can 
 influence hardware manufacturers as well as middleware and system-level 
 software developers\, and vice versa. In particular\, we seek to determine
  how co-design is employed in the development of the new HPC processors 
 and of the related software stack\, including with respect to compilers 
 and optimized libraries\, schedulers and IO\, and container technologies. 
 </p> <p>Hardware HPC vendors and integrators will share their vision on 
 co-design\, while key people from the scientific software development 
 community will discuss the adoption of state-of-the-art technologies when 
 porting their codes on emerging computer architectures. Consequently\, the
  workshop will provide a rare and valuable opportunity to foster close 
 contacts and the exchange of ideas between the scientific and technical 
 communities.</p>

SUMMARY:Optimizing Digital Teaching and Communication
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1370
DESCRIPTION:<p>In September 2021 we will hold a hands-on workshop on 
 e-learning techniques and strategies\, under the aegis of CECAM\, Psi-k 
 and the MaX (Material Design at Exascale) European Center of Excellence\, 
 aimed at teachers and researchers in electronic structure and HPC in 
 general.</p> <p>Join us!</p> <p>In this new world after the pandemic\, 
 experience and needs of those preparing online teaching have evolved. 
 Therefore\, we are organizing a hands-on workshop on online and blended 
 teaching\, that addresses the needs of the post-Covid era. There are 
 plenty of reasons to keep elements of teaching in an online form 
 permanently. </p> <p>Some workshop objectives are:</p> <ul> <li> How can 
 we learn from the past year? </li> <li> How can we <strong>offer our 
 online</strong> and blended <strong>teaching</strong> in a way that leads 
 <strong>to better learning and increased student satisfaction</strong>? 
 </li> <li> What are the <strong>pitfalls we must avoid</strong>? </li> 
 </ul> <p>We’ve set ourselves the challenge to bring this information to 
 you in an online format that will keep you engaged and motivated.</p> <ul>
  <li> You will <strong>leave the workshop with a set of online teaching 
 materials you will have prepared</strong>\, for your own courses\, talks 
 or science communication. </li> <li> You will not have the chance to hide 
 yourself anonymously behind your laptop\, and you <strong>will learn how 
 to avoid the same for your students or your audience.</strong> </li> </ul>
  <p>If you participate in this online workshop\, you may expect:</p> 
 <p>First a short self-paced online preparation course\, which you can take
  at any time between mid-August and mid-September 2021 (duration: 2-4 
 hours). Here you will learn the very basics\, and you will be guided to 
 set up the soft- and hardware you will need during the workshop (e.g. 
 video editing software\, polling tools\, ...).</p> <p>Four 3-hour live 
 online sessions spread from September 15 to September 22 (a detailed 
 timing will follow). During and after every session (yes\, there will be 
 home-work !) you will work on several tasks\, in small teams together with
  other participants.</p> <p>After September 22\, you will be given a 
 larger task that deals with a topic of your choice (e.g. something you 
 will need to teach about at your institute\, or a lecture you will have to
  give\, or simply a science topic you like). You will work on this for one
  week\, in interaction with a small team of other participants.</p> <p>On 
 October 1\, there is a final 3-hour online session where you will see what
  (some of) the other participants accomplished\, and where you will get 
 collective feedback as well as peer feedback on your work. </p> <p>If you 
 are interested to participate\, you should register in two different steps
  (both steps are mandatory):</p> <p>Step 1: register at CECAM<a

SUMMARY:First-principles simulations of materials with SIESTA
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1369
DESCRIPTION:<p>The school is aimed at students and researchers from 
 different disciplines who already use\, or plan to use\, first-principles 
 techniques to simulate properties of matter at the atomic scale. In 
 particular\, the school will focus on the SIESTA method [1\,2]. 
 Participants will learn its essential theoretical foundations\, and how to
  use the SIESTA code effectively. Pre- and post-processing tools will also
  be presented. The format of the school (completely online) allows for a 
 flexible offering of modules of different levels\, from basic to 
 advanced\, so that participants can adapt their syllabus. In addition\, 
 the material prepared for the school will be integrated into the corpus of
  SIESTA documentation\, which will remain available for continuous 
 learning.</p> <p><strong>FORMAT</strong></p> <p>The School will be 
 formally held in the week of June 28 -- July 2nd\, 2021\, but the week 
 before participants are expected to watch pre-recorded lectures\, prepare 
 their local computer setup [3]\, and work on simple exercises. Throughout 
 the School week\, live meetings will be offered in two tracks (morning and
  afternoon in Central-European Summer Time) to try to adapt to an audience
  distributed over different time zones\, and will consist of reviews of 
 relevant concepts (with Q&amp\;A sections) and guided hands-on 
 exercises.</p> <p>An online support forum will be open before\, during\, 
 and for some time after the canonical school dates to provide further 
 guidance\, to answer questions\, and to facilitate discussions between 
 school students and tutors.</p> <p><strong>COURSE MATERIALS</strong></p> 
 <p>The materials for the school will consist of:</p> <ul> <li>Pre-recorded
  video lectures covering the necessary theoretical background and/or how-
 to's for specific features.</li> <li>An online repository of documentation
  and how-to guides.</li> <li>A virtual machine or container\, based on the
  Quantum Mobile [3]\, packaged with the necessary codes and supporting 
 school files\, for the hands-on exercises.</li> </ul> 
 <p><strong>PROGRAM</strong></p> <p>The live sessions of the school will 
 take place from 09:30 to 12:30 CEST (Track A) and from 16:00 to 19:00 CEST
  (Track B)\, with breaks. It is expected that two modules will be covered 
 in each session.</p> <p>Background lectures and hands-on modules will 
 cover an assortment of topics\, from basic and fundamental to advanced. 
 Students focusing on basic to medium level topics will be able to work on 
 the relevant modules throughout the school. More advanced students will be
  able to prepare their own selection of topics.</p> <p>(Please check <a 
 href="https://siesta-project.org/siesta/events/SIESTA_School-2021/">this 
 page</a> for updates and further details.)</p> 
 <p><strong>REGISTRATION</strong></p> <p>Persons interested in registering 
 for the School need to <strong>submit two registration forms</strong>. 
 </p> <p>First\, they must apply through the “Participate” tab of<a 
 href="https://members.cecam.org/login"> the CECAM web page</a>. </p> 
 <p>Second\, they need to submit the online form at <a href="https://forms.
 office.com/r/BQYpMkku4V">https://forms.office.com/r/BQYpMkku4V</a> using 
 the same email address that they provided to CECAM.</p> <p>Apart from 
 basic identification and affiliation data\, prospective students will be 
 asked to provide a brief statement of motivation\, a very brief CV (one 
 paragraph)\, and indications of preferences for topics. <strong>Please 
 submit both forms\, persons who only apply through one of the two forms 
 will not be accepted</strong> to the school.</p> <p>For practical reasons 
 the school is organized to handle only a finite number of students in the 
 live sessions\, hence we must limit the number of officially registered 
 participants. Nevertheless\, the material and some forum channels will be 
 available at a later date also for those not officially admitted to the 
 school.</p> <p>The deadline for applications is the <strong>4th June 
 2021</strong>. We will communicate our acceptance decisions by the 11th 
 June. Accepted participants will be given access to the materials starting
  on the 21st June.</p> <h2>References</h2> <p>[1] José M Soler\, Emilio

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:<!DOCTYPE HTML><HTML><BODY><p>The school is 
 aimed at students and researchers from different disciplines who already 
 use, or plan to use, first-principles techniques to simulate properties of
  matter at the atomic scale. In particular, the school will focus on the 
 SIESTA method [1,2]. Participants will learn its essential theoretical 
 foundations, and how to use the SIESTA code effectively. Pre- and post-
 processing tools will also be presented. The format of the school 
 (completely online) allows for a flexible offering of modules of different
  levels, from basic to advanced, so that participants can adapt their 
 syllabus. In addition, the material prepared for the school will be 
 integrated into the corpus of SIESTA documentation, which will remain 
 available for continuous learning.</p> <p><strong>FORMAT</strong></p> 
 <p>The School will be formally held in the week of June 28 -- July 2nd, 
 2021, but the week before participants are expected to watch pre-recorded 
 lectures, prepare their local computer setup [3], and work on simple 
 exercises. Throughout the School week, live meetings will be offered in 
 two tracks (morning and afternoon in Central-European Summer Time) to try 
 to adapt to an audience distributed over different time zones, and will 
 consist of reviews of relevant concepts (with Q&amp;A sections) and guided
  hands-on exercises.</p> <p>An online support forum will be open before, 
 during, and for some time after the canonical school dates to provide 
 further guidance, to answer questions, and to facilitate discussions 
 between school students and tutors.</p> <p><strong>COURSE 
 MATERIALS</strong></p> <p>The materials for the school will consist 
 of:</p> <ul> <li>Pre-recorded video lectures covering the necessary 
 theoretical background and/or how-to's for specific features.</li> <li>An 
 online repository of documentation and how-to guides.</li> <li>A virtual 
 machine or container, based on the Quantum Mobile [3], packaged with the 
 necessary codes and supporting school files, for the hands-on 
 exercises.</li> </ul> <p><strong>PROGRAM</strong></p> <p>The live sessions
  of the school will take place from 09:30 to 12:30 CEST (Track A) and from
  16:00 to 19:00 CEST (Track B), with breaks. It is expected that two 
 modules will be covered in each session.</p> <p>Background lectures and 
 hands-on modules will cover an assortment of topics, from basic and 
 fundamental to advanced. Students focusing on basic to medium level topics
  will be able to work on the relevant modules throughout the school. More 
 advanced students will be able to prepare their own selection of 
 topics.</p> <p>(Please check <a href="https://siesta-
 project.org/siesta/events/SIESTA_School-2021/">this page</a> for updates 
 and further details.)</p> <p><strong>REGISTRATION</strong></p> <p>Persons 
 interested in registering for the School need to <strong>submit two 
 registration forms</strong>. </p> <p>First, they must apply through the 
 “Participate” tab of<a href="https://members.cecam.org/login"> the CECAM 
 web page</a>. </p> <p>Second, they need to submit the online form at <a hr
 ef="https://forms.office.com/r/BQYpMkku4V">https://forms.office.com/r/BQYp
 Mkku4V</a> using the same email address that they provided to CECAM.</p> 
 <p>Apart from basic identification and affiliation data, prospective 
 students will be asked to provide a brief statement of motivation, a very 
 brief CV (one paragraph), and indications of preferences for topics. 
 <strong>Please submit both forms, persons who only apply through one of 
 the two forms will not be accepted</strong> to the school.</p> <p>For 
 practical reasons the school is organized to handle only a finite number 
 of students in the live sessions, hence we must limit the number of 
 officially registered participants. Nevertheless, the material and some 
 forum channels will be available at a later date also for those not 
 officially admitted to the school.</p> <p>The deadline for applications is
  the <strong>4th June 2021</strong>. We will communicate our acceptance 
 decisions by the 11th June. Accepted participants will be given access to 
 the materials starting on the 21st June.</p> <h2>References</h2> <p>[1]

SUMMARY:Advanced school on Quantum Transport using SIESTA
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1374
DESCRIPTION:<p>This five-day online school will focus on the field of 
 theoretical condensed matter electronic transport exploiting the non-
 equilibrium Green’s function approach. In particular\, recent advances in 
 transport theory [1] will be presented in the form of lectures and hands-
 on sessions on hot topics in the field. The teachers will present novel 
 methods used for materials research modelling. The participants will learn
  the advanced features of SIESTA [2]\, such as the calculations of non-
 equilibrium properties using the TranSIESTA/TBtrans approach and the 
 python framework SISL [3]. For example\, the school lectures will cover a 
 recent scheme introducing truly single-junction transport calculations [4]
  and the new implementations to include in the transport calculations 
 different corrections to the Hamiltonian accounting for electron-phonon 
 coupling [5]\, spin orbit coupling and electronic correlation. Moreover\, 
 the users will learn how to extract a tight-binding Hamiltonian from a DFT
  Hamiltonian allowing them to deal with very large systems [6\,7].</p> 
 <p>The lectures will take place via Zoom with an invited list of speakers 
 who will present their work in a variety of fields in which the covered 
 tools have been used. Each topic will be followed by a hands-on session 
 allowing participants first-hand experience with the tools and 
 analysis.</p> <p>While this is an open workshop (for everybody!)\, we ask 
 participants to sign-up due to content distribution prior to the workshop 
 itself.</p> <p>The workshop will also host 2 evenings with online poster 
 sessions\, and all participants are expected to present their research in 
 one of the two sessions.</p> <p><strong>The deadline for the abstract 
 submission is April 1 th.</strong></p> <p>For more details follow <a

 <p><strong>Detailed School Topics:</strong></p> <p><em>Advanced usage of 
 SIESTA\, TranSIESTA/TBtrans and sisl</em></p> <p>Participants will learn 
 how to use the advanced features implemented in the aforementioned code 
 and python framework. In particular students will be taught how to perform
  efficient DFT+NEGF calculations\, pre-processing\, post-processing 
 analysis and data visualization.</p> <p><em>Electrochemistry</em></p> 
 <p>First principles simulations are now crucial in many areas of materials
  science. However\, this has not yet reached the field of 
 electrochemistry\, where the complexity of the electrochemical environment
  and the presence of the external electrode potential are difficulties 
 that have precluded direct application of the usual first-principles 
 methods like DFT. We will explain how some of these problems\, like the 
 presence of the electrostatic potential\, can be tackled using 
 TranSIESTA.</p> <p><em>Topological Insulators</em></p> <p>Topological 
 insulators (TI) are a phase of matter characterized by a bulk energy gap 
 and conducting surface (or edge) states symmetry-protected against small 
 perturbations. Quantum transport simulations are crucial to compute and 
 validate the topological properties of materials. We will show how SIESTA 
 can be used to predict the essential features of topological materials\, 
 leveraging on the recent Spin-Orbit Coupling implementation and SISL.</p> 
 <p><em>Inelastic transport</em></p> <p>The modelling of inelastic effects 
 due to the electron-phonon coupling in nano-scale devices is of great 
 technological importance as it impacts both the transport properties and 
 Joule heating. It is especially challenging to include the effects in 
 large-scale atomistic first principles device simulations. We will discuss
  how this can be addressed using various approximations and introduce the 
 Inelastica package (<a href="https://github.com/tfrederiksen/inelastica/">
 https://github.com/tfrederiksen/inelastica/</a>) based on TranSIESTA.</p> 
 <p><em>Correlated systems and the meanfield Hubbard model</em></p> 
 <p>Coulomb repulsion between electrons can lead to unpaired electron 
 states and interesting spin structures. For graphene-like nanostructures 
 the meanfield Hubbard model provides a simple and\, yet\, often sufficient
  method to understand how electronic interactions lead to magnetism. We 
 will describe an implementation of this model based on SISL.</p> 
 <p><em>Single contacts by removal of periodic images</em></p> 
 <p>Understanding transport properties under non-equilibrium is of vital 
 importance to the development of next-generation electronics. A basic 
 principle of conducting such simulations is by using Bloch’s theorem which
  has the disadvantage of adding a periodic image of the junction. We will 
 present how users can overcome this limitation and simulate truly single 
 junctions.</p> <p><em>Modelling of extremely large-systems with DFT 
 precision</em></p> <p>Recent increase in compute power is rapidly 
 decreasing the gap between experimental and theoretical works. This allows
  theoreticians to study one-to-one samples matching an exact experiment. 
 However\, there is still some way to go in terms of scalability and 
 precision. Here we present a method to extract the important part of a 
 Hamiltonian in an energy window allowing simulations of transport 
 properties of even larger systems by retaining the band-structure without 
 using any wannierization techniques.</p> <h2>References</h2> <p>[1] N.

SUMMARY:All electron DFT with Fleur - a Hands-on Tutorial
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1371
DESCRIPTION:<p>The density-functional theory (DFT) in its various 
 incarnation provides the most practical framework to compute basic 
 electronic\, magnetic\, and structural properties of materials. Large 
 scale materials screening using DFT is believed to be a key factor in 
 future materials development. The full-potential linearized augmented 
 planewave (FLAPW) method has emerged as a robust and precise state-of-the-
 art technique with reasonable computational efficiency. It is widely 
 accepted as providing the reference solution. However\, the use and 
 application of DFT methods and of FLAPW in particular require a thorough 
 training where users meet developers of such methods.</p> <p>Hence this 
 tutorial focuses on training the participants in using our all-electron 
 FLAPW DFT code <a href="http://www.flapw.de/">FLEUR</a>. A special focus 
 will be on the usage of FLEUR within the AiiDA infrastructure to build 
 automatic work-flows applicable to materials screening applications.</p> 
 <p>The tutorial covers theoretical lectures to provide the necessary 
 methodological and physical background to professionally use the FLEUR 
 code family and enable the participants to benefit from the strengths of 
 the codes. Hands-on sessions are provided to get in touch with the codes 
 from a practical perspective.</p> <p>Our school will consist of lectures 
 covering three main areas:</p> <ul> <li>the underlying basic theory\,</li>
  <li>the installation and usage of FLEUR and its <a 
 href="http://www.aiida.net/">AiiDA</a> interface\,</li> <li>more 
 specialized topics relevant for typical FLEUR calculations.</li> </ul>

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:<!DOCTYPE HTML><HTML><BODY><p>The density-
 functional theory (DFT) in its various incarnation provides the most 
 practical framework to compute basic electronic, magnetic, and structural 
 properties of materials. Large scale materials screening using DFT is 
 believed to be a key factor in future materials development. The full-
 potential linearized augmented planewave (FLAPW) method has emerged as a 
 robust and precise state-of-the-art technique with reasonable 
 computational efficiency. It is widely accepted as providing the reference
  solution. However, the use and application of DFT methods and of FLAPW in
  particular require a thorough training where users meet developers of 
 such methods.</p> <p>Hence this tutorial focuses on training the 
 participants in using our all-electron FLAPW DFT code <a 
 href="http://www.flapw.de/">FLEUR</a>. A special focus will be on the 
 usage of FLEUR within the AiiDA infrastructure to build automatic work-
 flows applicable to materials screening applications.</p> <p>The tutorial 
 covers theoretical lectures to provide the necessary methodological and 
 physical background to professionally use the FLEUR code family and enable
  the participants to benefit from the strengths of the codes. Hands-on 
 sessions are provided to get in touch with the codes from a practical 
 perspective.</p> <p>Our school will consist of lectures covering three 
 main areas:</p> <ul> <li>the underlying basic theory,</li> <li>the 
 installation and usage of FLEUR and its <a 
 href="http://www.aiida.net/">AiiDA</a> interface,</li> <li>more 
 specialized topics relevant for typical FLEUR calculations.</li> </ul>

SUMMARY:AiiDA Virtual Tutorial
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1375
DESCRIPTION:<p>The goal of this 4 day-tutorial is to help students and 
 researchers from the field of computational materials science get started 
 with writing reproducible workflows. They will be introduced by experts in
  the field (including the developers of the code) to the use of AiiDA\, a 
 state-of-the-art framework for provenance tracking and workflow management
  designed to support high-throughput research\, and will gain in-depth 
 hands-on experience using a tool that they can directly apply to their own
  research. Participation both from academia and from industry is 
 encouraged.</p> <p>The AiiDA framework is a tool for workflow management 
 and provenance tracking\, which is backed by a significant community of 
 users and developers\, and has interfaces to more than 30 materials 
 science codes (see <a href="http://aiidateam.github.io/aiida-
 registry">plugin registry</a>)\, including (among others) to the ab initio
  codes Quantum ESPRESSO\, VASP\, cp2k\, Castep\, Siesta\, Fleur\, 
 Crystal\, NWChem\, Wannier90\, and Yambo. AiiDA’s permissive open source 
 license (MIT) enables participants to use it both in academic and 
 commercial settings. By virtue of its general design and flexible plugin 
 system\, AiiDA is easily extended to new codes and new use cases.</p> 
 <p>Talks will be pre-recorded and made available to participants before 
 the event\, and hands-on tutorials will be held <em>via</em> <a 
 href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>. In order to avoid losing time on 
 installation issues\, participants will have the option to connect to 
 virtual machines preconfigured with AiiDA (or to come with AiiDA already 
 installed on their laptop via the <a 
 href="https://www.materialscloud.org/work/quantum-mobile">Quantum Mobile 
 virtual machine</a>).</p> <p>The event will mostly focus on in-depth 
 tutorials on using AiiDA and on writing workflows. It will also include 
 some talks on how AiiDA has been already used in production\, given by the
  organisers and the core developers of AiiDA\; on advanced aspects of 
 workflow management\; on designing and writing new AiiDA plugins\; and on 
 research data management (RDM) and how to write data management plans 
 (DMPs)\, especially when using AiiDA and the <a 
 href="https://www.materialscloud.org/">Materials Cloud</a>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Speakers &amp\; organisers</strong></p> <p>The tutorial is 
 organised by <strong>Chris Sewell (EPFL\, CH)\, Marnik Bercx (EPFL\, CH) 
 </strong>and<strong> Giovanni Pizzi (EPFL\, CH).</strong></p> <p>Tutorial 
 lectures and assistance during hands-on session will be provided by the

SUMMARY:Integration of ESL modules into electronic-structure codes
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1376
DESCRIPTION:<p>The evolutionary pressure on electronic structure software 
 development is greatly increasing\, due to the emergence of new 
 paradigms\, new kinds of users\, new processes\, and new tools. Electronic
  structure software complexity is consequently also increasing\, requiring
  a larger effort on code maintenance. Developers of large electronic 
 structure codes are trying to relieve some complexity by transitioning 
 standardized algorithms into separate libraries [BigDFT-PSolver\, ELPA\, 
 ELSI\, LibXC\, LibGridXC\, etc.]. This paradigm shift requires library 
 developers to have a hybrid developer profile where the scientific and 
 computational skill set becomes equally important. These topics have been 
 extensively and publicly discussed between developers of various projects 
 including ABINIT\, ASE\, ATK\, BigDFT\, CASTEP\, FHI-aims\, GPAW\, 
 Octopus\, Quantum Espresso\, SIESTA\, and SPR-KKR.</p> <p>High-quality 
 standardized libraries are not only a highly challenging effort lying at 
 the hands of the library developers\, they also open possibilities for 
 codes to take advantage of a standard way to access commonly used 
 algorithms. Integration of these libraries\, however\, requires a 
 significant initial effort that is often sacrificed for new developments 
 that often not even reach the mainstream branch of the code. 
 Additionally\, there are multiple challenges in adopting new libraries 
 which have their roots in a variety of issues: installation\, data 
 structures\, physical units and parallelism - all of which are code-
 dependent. On the other hand\, adoption of common libraries ensures the 
 immediate propagation of improvements within the respective library’s 
 field of research and ensures codes are up-to-date with much less effort 
 [LibXC]. Indeed\, well-established libraries can have a huge impact on 
 multiple scientific communities at once [PETSc].</p> <p>In the Electronic 
 Structure community\, two issues are emerging. Libraries are being 
 developed [esl\, esl-gitlab] but require an ongoing commitment from the 
 community with respect to sharing the maintenance and development effort. 
 Secondly\, existing codes will benefit from libraries by adopting their 
 use. Both issues are mainly governed by the exposure of the libraries and 
 the availability of library core developers\, which are typically 
 researchers pressured by publication deliverables and fund-raising 
 burdens. They are thus not able to commit a large fraction of their time 
 to software development.</p> <p>An effort to allow code developers to make
  use of\, and develop\, shared components is needed. This requires an 
 efficient coordination between various elements:</p> <p>A common and 
 consistent code development infrastructure/education in terms of 
 compilation\, installation\, testing and documentation.<br> - How to use 
 and integrate already published libraries into existing projects.<br> -
