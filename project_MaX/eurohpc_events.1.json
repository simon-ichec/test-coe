In particular, the school will focus on the SIESTA method [1,2]. Participants will learn its essential theoretical foundations, and how to use the SIESTA code effectively. Pre- and post-processing tools will also be presented. The format of the school (completely online) allows for a flexible offering of modules of different levels, from basic to advanced, so that participants can adapt their syllabus. In addition, the material prepared for the school will be integrated into the corpus of SIESTA documentation, which will remain available for continuous learning.\n\n**FORMAT**\n\nThe School will be formally held in the week of June 28 -- July 2nd, 2021, but the week before participants are expected to watch pre-recorded lectures, prepare their local computer setup [3], and work on simple exercises. Throughout the School week, live meetings will be offered in two tracks (morning and afternoon in Central-European Summer Time) to try to adapt to an audience distributed over different time zones, and will consist of reviews of relevant concepts (with Q&A sections) and guided hands-on exercises.\n\nAn online support forum will be open before, during, and for some time after the canonical school dates to provide further guidance, to answer questions, and to facilitate discussions between school students and tutors.\n\n**COURSE MATERIALS**\n\nThe materials for the school will consist of:\n\n  * Pre-recorded video lectures covering the necessary theoretical background and/or how-to's for specific features.\n  * An online repository of documentation and how-to guides.\n  * A virtual machine or container, based on the Quantum Mobile [3], packaged with the necessary codes and supporting school files, for the hands-on exercises.\n\n\n\n**PROGRAM**\n\nThe live sessions of the school will take place from 09:30 to 12:30 CEST (Track A) and from 16:00 to 19:00 CEST (Track B), with breaks. It is expected that two modules will be covered in each session.\n\nBackground lectures and hands-on modules will cover an assortment of topics, from basic and fundamental to advanced. Students focusing on basic to medium level topics will be able to work on the relevant modules throughout the school. More advanced students will be able to prepare their own selection of topics.\n\n(Please check this page for updates and further details.)\n\n**REGISTRATION**\n\nPersons interested in registering for the School need to **submit two registration forms**. \n\nFirst, they must apply through the \u201cParticipate\u201d tab of the CECAM web page. \n\nSecond, they need to submit the online form at https://forms.office.com/r/BQYpMkku4V using the same email address that they provided to CECAM.\n\nApart from basic identification and affiliation data, prospective students will be asked to provide a brief statement of motivation, a very brief CV (one paragraph), and indications of preferences for topics. **Please submit both forms, persons who only apply through one of the two forms will not be accepted** to the school.\n\nFor practical reasons the school is organized to handle only a finite number of students in the live sessions, hence we must limit the number of officially registered participants.

In particular students will be taught how to perform efficient DFT+NEGF calculations, pre-processing, post-processing analysis and data visualization.\n\n_Electrochemistry_\n\nFirst principles simulations are now crucial in many areas of materials science. However, this has not yet reached the field of electrochemistry, where the complexity of the electrochemical environment and the presence of the external electrode potential are difficulties that have precluded direct application of the usual first-principles methods like DFT. We will explain how some of these problems, like the presence of the electrostatic potential, can be tackled using TranSIESTA.\n\n_Topological Insulators_\n\nTopological insulators (TI) are a phase of matter characterized by a bulk energy gap and conducting surface (or edge) states symmetry-protected against small perturbations. Quantum transport simulations are crucial to compute and validate the topological properties of materials. We will show how SIESTA can be used to predict the essential features of topological materials, leveraging on the recent Spin-Orbit Coupling implementation and SISL.\n\n_Inelastic transport_\n\nThe modelling of inelastic effects due to the electron-phonon coupling in nano-scale devices is of great technological importance as it impacts both the transport properties and Joule heating. It is especially challenging to include the effects in large-scale atomistic first principles device simulations. We will discuss how this can be addressed using various approximations and introduce the Inelastica package (https://github.com/tfrederiksen/inelastica/) based on TranSIESTA.\n\n_Correlated systems and the meanfield Hubbard model_\n\nCoulomb repulsion between electrons can lead to unpaired electron states and interesting spin structures. For graphene-like nanostructures the meanfield Hubbard model provides a simple and, yet, often sufficient method to understand how electronic interactions lead to magnetism. We will describe an implementation of this model based on SISL.\n\n_Single contacts by removal of periodic images_\n\nUnderstanding transport properties under non-equilibrium is of vital importance to the development of next-generation electronics. A basic principle of conducting such simulations is by using Bloch\u2019s theorem which has the disadvantage of adding a periodic image of the junction. We will present how users can overcome this limitation and simulate truly single junctions.\n\n_Modelling of extremely large-systems with DFT precision_\n\nRecent increase in compute power is rapidly decreasing the gap between experimental and theoretical works. This allows theoreticians to study one-to-one samples matching an exact experiment. However, there is still some way to go in terms of scalability and precision. Here we present a method to extract the important part of a Hamiltonian in an energy window allowing simulations of transport properties of even larger systems by retaining the band-structure without using any wannierization techniques.\n\n## References\n\n[1] N.

We will explain how some of these problems, like the presence of the electrostatic potential, can be tackled using TranSIESTA.\n\n_Topological Insulators_\n\nTopological insulators (TI) are a phase of matter characterized by a bulk energy gap and conducting surface (or edge) states symmetry-protected against small perturbations. Quantum transport simulations are crucial to compute and validate the topological properties of materials. We will show how SIESTA can be used to predict the essential features of topological materials, leveraging on the recent Spin-Orbit Coupling implementation and SISL.\n\n_Inelastic transport_\n\nThe modelling of inelastic effects due to the electron-phonon coupling in nano-scale devices is of great technological importance as it impacts both the transport properties and Joule heating. It is especially challenging to include the effects in large-scale atomistic first principles device simulations. We will discuss how this can be addressed using various approximations and introduce the Inelastica package (<https://github.com/tfrederiksen/inelastica/>) based on TranSIESTA.\n\n_Correlated systems and the meanfield Hubbard model_\n\nCoulomb repulsion between electrons can lead to unpaired electron states and interesting spin structures. For graphene-like nanostructures the meanfield Hubbard model provides a simple and, yet, often sufficient method to understand how electronic interactions lead to magnetism. We will describe an implementation of this model based on SISL.\n\n_Single contacts by removal of periodic images_\n\nUnderstanding transport properties under non-equilibrium is of vital importance to the development of next-generation electronics. A basic principle of conducting such simulations is by using Bloch\u2019s theorem which has the disadvantage of adding a periodic image of the junction. We will present how users can overcome this limitation and simulate truly single junctions.\n\n_Modelling of extremely large-systems with DFT precision_\n\nRecent increase in compute power is rapidly decreasing the gap between experimental and theoretical works. This allows theoreticians to study one-to-one samples matching an exact experiment. However, there is still some way to go in terms of scalability and precision. Here we present a method to extract the important part of a Hamiltonian in an energy window allowing simulations of transport properties of even larger systems by retaining the band-structure without using any wannierization techniques.\n\n## References\n\n[1] N.
