Therefore, we are organizing a hands-on workshop on online and blended teaching, that addresses the needs of the post-Covid era. There are plenty of reasons to keep elements of teaching in an online form permanently. \n\nSome workshop objectives are:\n\n  * How can we learn from the past year? \n  * How can we **offer our online** and blended **teaching** in a way that leads **to better learning and increased student satisfaction**? \n  * What are the **pitfalls we must avoid**? \n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve set ourselves the challenge to bring this information to you in an online format that will keep you engaged and motivated.\n\n  * You will **leave the workshop with a set of online teaching materials you will have prepared** , for your own courses, talks or science communication. \n  * You will not have the chance to hide yourself anonymously behind your laptop, and you **will learn how to avoid the same for your students or your audience.**\n\n\n\nIf you participate in this online workshop, you may expect:\n\nFirst a short self-paced online preparation course, which you can take at any time between mid-August and mid-September 2021 (duration: 2-4 hours). Here you will learn the very basics, and you will be guided to set up the soft- and hardware you will need during the workshop (e.g. video editing software, polling tools, ...).\n\nFour 3-hour live online sessions spread from September 15 to September 22 (a detailed timing will follow). During and after every session (yes, there will be home-work !) you will work on several tasks, in small teams together with other participants.\n\nAfter September 22, you will be given a larger task that deals with a topic of your choice (e.g. something you will need to teach about at your institute, or a lecture you will have to give, or simply a science topic you like). You will work on this for one week, in interaction with a small team of other participants.\n\nOn October 1, there is a final 3-hour online session where you will see what (some of) the other participants accomplished, and where you will get collective feedback as well as peer feedback on your work. \n\nIf you are interested to participate, you should register in two different steps (both steps are mandatory):\n\nStep 1: register at CECAM[ via this form](https://members.cecam.org/workshops/participate/6) (attention: if you don't have one yet,[ create a CECAM account first](https://members.cecam.org/register))\n\nStep 2: register[ via this form](https://forms.gle/6mTiigF7y1i1TMRh6).\n\nDeadline: September 8th, 2021\n\nStefaan Cottenier (Ghent University)\n\nAndrea Cucca (CNRS)\n\nRex Godby (University of York)\n\nMyrta Gr\u00fcning (Queen's University Belfast)\n\nGian-Marco Rignanese (Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain)\n\nFrancesco Sottile (Ecole Polytechnique)\n\nMatthieu Verstraete (University of Liege)\n\nZeila Zanolli (Utrecht University)", "summary": "In September 2021 we will hold a hands-on workshop on e-learning techniques and strategies, under the aegis of CECAM, Psi-k and the..."}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "Event", "name": "First-principles simulations of materials with SIESTA", "url": "http://www.max-centre.eu/news-events/first-principles-simulations-materials-siesta-0", "description": "The school is aimed at students and researchers from different disciplines who already use, or plan to use, first-principles techniques to simulate properties of matter at the atomic scale.
