In particular, recent advances in transport theory [1] will be presented in the form of lectures and hands-on sessions on hot topics in the field. The teachers will present novel methods used for materials research modelling. The participants will learn the advanced features of SIESTA [2], such as the calculations of non-equilibrium properties using the TranSIESTA/TBtrans approach and the python framework SISL [3]. For example, the school lectures will cover a recent scheme introducing truly single-junction transport calculations [4] and the new implementations to include in the transport calculations different corrections to the Hamiltonian accounting for electron-phonon coupling [5], spin orbit coupling and electronic correlation. Moreover, the users will learn how to extract a tight-binding Hamiltonian from a DFT Hamiltonian allowing them to deal with very large systems [6,7].\n\nThe lectures will take place via Zoom with an invited list of speakers who will present their work in a variety of fields in which the covered tools have been used. Each topic will be followed by a hands-on session allowing participants first-hand experience with the tools and analysis.\n\nWhile this is an open workshop (for everybody!), we ask participants to sign-up due to content distribution prior to the workshop itself.\n\nThe workshop will also host 2 evenings with online poster sessions, and all participants are expected to present their research in one of the two sessions.\n\n**The deadline for the abstract submission is April 1 th.**\n\nFor more details follow this link\n\nIn collaboration with \n\n**Provisional program**\n\nDay 1: Introduction to NEGF theory and hands-on with TBtrans, TranSiesta and SISL\n\nDay 2: DFT-TB parametrization and surrounding real space self-energies, evening poster session\n\nDay 3: Topological insulators and inelastic transport mechanisms, evening poster session\n\nDay 4: Electrochemistry and electron correlation in graphene nano structures\n\nDay 5: Solution to participant projects and _ad-hoc_ follow up questions\n\nUp to one month before the school, participants are invited to submit project suggestions (for the last day of the school) via this GitHub repository (please do so ASAP!) submit project suggestion here.\n\nWe invite everybody to join the online school (link will follow) and all material will be made available at https://github.com/zerothi/ts-tbt-sisl-tutorial\n\n**Detailed School Topics:**\n\n_Advanced usage of SIESTA, TranSIESTA/TBtrans and sisl_\n\nParticipants will learn how to use the advanced features implemented in the aforementioned code and python framework. In particular students will be taught how to perform efficient DFT+NEGF calculations, pre-processing, post-processing analysis and data visualization.\n\n_Electrochemistry_\n\nFirst principles simulations are now crucial in many areas of materials science. However, this has not yet reached the field of electrochemistry, where the complexity of the electrochemical environment and the presence of the external electrode potential are difficulties that have precluded direct application of the usual first-principles methods like DFT. We will explain how some of these problems, like the presence of the electrostatic potential, can be tackled using TranSIESTA.\n\n_Topological Insulators_\n\nTopological insulators (TI) are a phase of matter characterized by a bulk energy gap and conducting surface (or edge) states symmetry-protected against small perturbations. Quantum transport simulations are crucial to compute and validate the topological properties of materials. We will show how SIESTA can be used to predict the essential features of topological materials, leveraging on the recent Spin-Orbit Coupling implementation and SISL.\n\n_Inelastic transport_\n\nThe modelling of inelastic effects due to the electron-phonon coupling in nano-scale devices is of great technological importance as it impacts both the transport properties and Joule heating. It is especially challenging to include the effects in large-scale atomistic first principles device simulations. We will discuss how this can be addressed using various approximations and introduce the Inelastica package (https://github.com/tfrederiksen/inelastica/) based on TranSIESTA.\n\n_Correlated systems and the meanfield Hubbard model_\n\nCoulomb repulsion between electrons can lead to unpaired electron states and interesting spin structures. For graphene-like nanostructures the meanfield Hubbard model provides a simple and, yet, often sufficient method to understand how electronic interactions lead to magnetism. We will describe an implementation of this model based on SISL.\n\n_Single contacts by removal of periodic images_\n\nUnderstanding transport properties under non-equilibrium is of vital importance to the development of next-generation electronics. A basic principle of conducting such simulations is by using Bloch\u2019s theorem which has the disadvantage of adding a periodic image of the junction. We will present how users can overcome this limitation and simulate truly single junctions.\n\n_Modelling of extremely large-systems with DFT precision_\n\nRecent increase in compute power is rapidly decreasing the gap between experimental and theoretical works. This allows theoreticians to study one-to-one samples matching an exact experiment. However, there is still some way to go in terms of scalability and precision. Here we present a method to extract the important part of a Hamiltonian in an energy window allowing simulations of transport properties of even larger systems by retaining the band-structure without using any wannierization techniques.\n\n## References\n\n[1] N.

Large scale materials screening using DFT is believed to be a key factor in future materials development. The full-potential linearized augmented planewave (FLAPW) method has emerged as a robust and precise state-of-the-art technique with reasonable computational efficiency. It is widely accepted as providing the reference solution. However, the use and application of DFT methods and of FLAPW in particular require a thorough training where users meet developers of such methods.\n\nHence this tutorial focuses on training the participants in using our all-electron FLAPW DFT code [FLEUR](http://www.flapw.de/). A special focus will be on the usage of FLEUR within the AiiDA infrastructure to build automatic work-flows applicable to materials screening applications.\n\nThe tutorial covers theoretical lectures to provide the necessary methodological and physical background to professionally use the FLEUR code family and enable the participants to benefit from the strengths of the codes. Hands-on sessions are provided to get in touch with the codes from a practical perspective.\n\nOur school will consist of lectures covering three main areas:\n\n  * the underlying basic theory,\n  * the installation and usage of FLEUR and its [AiiDA](http://www.aiida.net/) interface,\n  * more specialized topics relevant for typical FLEUR calculations.\n\n\n\n**Registration:[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUUvKg9N0EUihXJOwyA6ybY3OMAmSKVXcJ86Ymk8UBnvdQpw/viewform) **(deadline 21.03.2021)\n\nComplete info [here](https://www.flapw.de/MaX-5.0/handson/)\n\nIn collaboration with ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Q5sFauyWHQrSZaZd8TYkytpBy3x84KY_STSPtz_7Nxou4Mb9uFRHmbP92VZ7A8lk9gy7xoxkOIilKBmr0XiXY46djK5odpKSGfrtpvC6rFzEPkYWD2XCVKH6kXVa-1qIWYwwmt3P)", "summary": "The density-functional theory (DFT) in its various incarnation provides the most practical framework to compute basic electronic,..."}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "Event", "name": "Virtual school on electronic excitations in solids and nanostructures using the Yambo code", "url": "http://www.max-centre.eu/news-events/virtual-school-electronic-excitations-solids-and-nanostructures-using-yambo-code", "description": "The MaX/CECAM virtual school will last four days and will be held on **April 8, 9 (week 1) and April 15, 16 (week 2) 2021** using the online platform Zoom. \n\nThe school aims to introduce participants to post-DFT simulations, in particular to many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) approaches and will provide both theoretical overviews and practical training on the calculation of electronic and optical properties of solids and nanostructures.\n\nParticipants will attend theoretical lessons on Many-Body Perturbation Theory - organised in short modules - that will introduce them to the concepts based on the linear response, GW and Bethe-Salpeter calculations.
