This will allow to study systems of higher complexity (in space and time) and to achieve higher accuracy and precision. In close contact with academia and industry, the **NOMAD CoE** will develop exascale software, artificial intelligence (Al) methods, and efficient workflows for an advanced materials modeling. The **NOMAD School focusses on \"exascale solutions in Green function methods and advanced DFT\"**.\n\nThe NOMAD School features **50-minute tutorial lectures** by renowned scientists of the field (see below and the PROGRAM) who will introduce their respective topics and address recent exascale achievements and prevailing challenges.\n\nNOMAD anticipates that the exascale challenge, which shows \"exaflops\" performance in some components of the codes, will be met by workflows handling high-throughput calculations and/or complex ensemble averages of statistical mechanics and artificial intelligence. To get more practical insights into all these topics, there will be hands-on tutorials and/or hackathons in the afternoon, run in parallel by key developers of the codes Abinit, exciting, FHI-aims, **GPAW** , and by **developers of ASE/ASR, CC4S and Mini-Apps**.
