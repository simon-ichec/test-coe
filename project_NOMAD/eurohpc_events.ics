SUMMARY:NOMAD&#039\;s Midsummer School: Towards exascale solutions in Green
  function methods and advanced DFT
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1325
DESCRIPTION:<p>With 10^18 floating point operations per second\, exascale 
 computers will be able to simulate and analyze complex processes in real 
 materials more realistically than what is possible today. This will allow 
 to study systems of higher complexity (in space and time) and to achieve 
 higher accuracy and precision. In close contact with academia and 
 industry\, the <strong>NOMAD CoE</strong> will develop exascale software\,
  artificial intelligence (Al) methods\, and efficient workflows for an 
 advanced materials modeling. The <strong>NOMAD School focusses on 
 "exascale solutions in Green function methods and advanced 
 DFT"</strong>.</p> <p> The NOMAD School features <strong>50-minute 
 tutorial lectures </strong>by renowned scientists of the field (see below 
 and the PROGRAM) who will introduce their respective topics and address 
 recent exascale achievements and prevailing challenges.</p> <p> NOMAD 
 anticipates that the exascale challenge\, which shows "exaflops" 
 performance in some components of the codes\, will be met by workflows 
 handling high-throughput calculations and/or complex ensemble averages of 
 statistical mechanics and artificial intelligence. To get more practical 
 insights into all these topics\, there will be hands-on tutorials and/or 
 hackathons in the afternoon\, run in parallel by key developers of the 
 codes Abinit\, exciting\, FHI-aims\, <strong>GPAW</strong>\, and by 
 <strong>developers of ASE/ASR\, CC4S and Mini-Apps</strong>. For 
 example:</p> <ul> <li>people presently using code A can learn about the 
 possible advantages of code B.</li> <li>people using any of the codes can 
 learn about and contribute to the workflow management of ASE/AS R.</li> 
 <li>people using any of the codes can learn about and contribute to the 
 development of the INTERFACE towards CC4S (coupled cluster for 
 solids).</li> <li>people using any of the codes can learn about and 
 contribute to the development of mini apps to check and analyze their code
  performance.</li> </ul> <p>The school is aimed at graduate students and 
 early-career postdocs. </p>

SUMMARY:High-throughput workflows for materials science with the Atomic 
 Simulation Environment and Fireworks
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1330
DESCRIPTION:<p>This 4-days combined workshop/hackathon (2-day/2-day) will 
 introduce young scientists from the electronic structure community to the 
 <em><strong>latest developments in the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)
  and Fireworks software packages</strong></em>.</p> <p>This meeting will 
 give developers and users of ASE the possibility to present and discuss 
 ongoing developments and to coordinate their efforts. A particular focus 
 shall be put on automatized high-throughput computations for which the 
 first fundamental steps are already implemented in ASE and are readily 
 available for customization and further development. To this end\, the 
 coupling to Fireworks/atomate as a code independent workflow engine will 
 be explored and possible synergy effects will be identified.</p> <p>The 
 first part of the workshop is <em><strong>intended for both younger 
 (PhD/postdocs) and experienced researchers with an interest in high-
 throughput electronic structure calculations and materials 
 design.</strong></em> The last part of the workshop comprises more 
 technical sessions aimed at bringing electronic structure (ES) code 
 developers up to date with the latest developments of ASE/Fireworks 
 related to high-throughput workflows\, and a hackathon aimed at extending 
 and improving the existing interfaces between ASE/Fireworks and ES codes 
 to take full advantage of new powerful features.</p>
