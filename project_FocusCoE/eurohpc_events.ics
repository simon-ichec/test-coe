 24th is dedicated to working on the selected code projects.</p> <p>The 
 workshop will be given by members of the application group of the MPCDF 
 together with experts from Intel and Nvidia. The registration is open and 
 can be accessed via the link on the left. The deadline for registration 
 for the lectures is November 12th\, for pure online participation\, you 
 can register until November 18th.</p> <p>The applicants for the hands-on 
 day are asked to test the building of the code on Raven and to prepare a 
 representative test case for the problem that they want to inspect 
 (ideally the test can be run on a single Raven node\, either GPU or CPU) 
 in advance of the workshop. Assistance by MPCDF is provided on 
 request.</p>

SUMMARY:Charting large materials dataspaces: AI methods and scalability
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1444
DESCRIPTION:Organisers <ul> <li>Luca Ghiringhelli (NOMAD Laboratory at the 
 Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society and Humboldt University\, 
 Berlin)</li> <li>James Kermode (University of Warwick)</li> <li>Markus 
 Rampp (Max Planck Computing and Data Facility (MPCDF))</li> </ul> 
 <p>Across a wide range of fields and in particular in materials science\, 
 there is increasing awareness that big data is a fundamental resource for 
 fostering deeper understanding of physical systems and ensuring 
 reproducibility of calculations.</p> <p>It is crucial to realize that 
 “big” does not refer only to the sheer amount of data\, but also to their 
 complexity. For example\, in materials science\, a material is typically 
 characterized by an intricate hierarchy of observables including ensemble 
 averages at various thermodynamic conditions. Another crucial aspect is 
 the need to validate and quantify uncertainty\, i.e.\, being able to 
 assign to any single entry in the database a level of accuracy so that 
 data points from disparate sources can be used concurrently in an 
 analysis.</p> <p>Such awareness has motivated the creation of large 
 computational materials-science databases. Some are “project-based”\, 
 i.e.\, collections of high-throughput scans of given materials classes 
 (e.g.\, AFLOW [1]\, Materials Project [2]\, OQMD [3])\, others collect 
 data from heterogeneous sources (e.g.\, NOMAD [4]\, Materials Cloud 
 [5]).</p> <p>In order for the data to be (re-)usable for new analyses and 
 possibly discoveries\, they have to comply with the so-called FAIR 
 (findable - accessible - interoperable - reusable/repurposable/recyclable)
  principles [6]. </p> <p>This requires complex\, hierarchical metadata 
 structures that annotate the data\, so that the users know the provenance 
 (settings\, purpose) of a calculation in order to judge whether an entry 
 can be part of a dataset to be analysed [7].</p> <p>The complexity and 
 extent of the existing databases\, which can only grow in both respects\, 
 reveals a rarely addressed challenge: the possibility to efficiently 
 <em>explore</em> the databases themselves in order to reveal patterns and 
 trends.</p> <p>Here\, exploration refers specifically to the possibility 
 of producing dynamic\, visual maps of the databases’ content. For 
 instance\, a user may be looking for ternary materials\, not containing 
 radioactive species\, and would like to understand how diverse are the 
 entries\, i.e.\, whether they are somewhat uniformly spanning the 
 materials space or are clustered into classes\, where understanding what 
 is common among class’ members is a challenge in itself.</p> <p>This and 
 similar kinds of questions call for interactive\, dynamic\, and 
 intelligent (i.e.\, artificial-intelligent-driven) tools\, which are also 
 efficient\, i.e.\, they are able to propose a meaningful solution within 
 seconds. </p> <p>In summary\, in order to harvest the yet unhearted 
 richness contained in presently known and future materials-science data\, 
 four pillars need to be concurrently developed:</p> <ul> <li>FAIR-
 compliant materials databases</li> <li>Identification of proper 
 descriptors and metrics for capturing the similarity amongst materials\, 
 including the complex restructuring occurring at varying environmental 
 conditions [8]</li> <li>Artificial-intelligence (AI) approaches for 
 exploratory analysis: clustering\, dimension reduction and corresponding 
 visualization that can reveal hidden patterns [9]</li> <li>Scalable 
 implementations\, combining clever choice of the hardware as well as 
 algorithmic speed-up (e.g.\, landmarking) [10]</li> </ul> <p>In this 
 workshop\, experts in all these aspects\, not necessarily limited to 
 materials-science applications\, will interact to confront ideas and 
 solutions for performing flexible\, interactive\, efficient\, and 
 insightful analyses of materials databases.</p> <h2>References</h2> <p><a

SUMMARY:Co-Design for HPC in Computational Materials and Molecular Science
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1443
DESCRIPTION:<p>The Workshop on HPC (High Performance Computing) Co-design 
 in Computational Materials and Molecular Science was initiated and is led 
 by the NOMAD Center of Excellence (www.nomad-coe.eu)\, and is organised by
  NOMAD in collaboration with the BioExcel\, MAX\, and TREX CoEs. </p> 
 <p>The workshop will gather contributions from leading scientists\, 
 technologies\, and SW engineers from the fields of academia\, HPC 
 centres\, HW-vendors\, and industry. The workshop covers a broad range of 
 current topics\, taking materials and molecular science codes as reference
  HPC applications and possible co-design vehicles. </p> <p>The topics to 
 be covered are:</p> <p>(1) existing examples of HPC co-design in materials
  and molecular science\,</p> <p>(2) co-design of general purpose and 
 domain-specific libraries\, kernels\, and mini-apps\, and</p> <p>(3) the 
 perspective of hardware manufacturers\, integrators\, and data center 
 owners.</p> <p>The workshop will focus in particular on\, and attempt to 
 draw conclusions about:</p> <p>(1) the relationship between algorithms and
  computer architectures in materials science\,</p> <p>(2) the connection 
 between parallel programming technologies and runtime systems\, and</p> 
 <p>(3) the interplay of the above layers for a wide spectrum of computer 
 architectures\, within the selected scientific domain. </p> <p>We aim to 
 identify how scientific software developers in materials science can 
 influence hardware manufacturers as well as middleware and system-level 
 software developers\, and vice versa. In particular\, we seek to determine
  how co-design is employed in the development of the new HPC processors 
 and of the related software stack\, including with respect to compilers 
 and optimized libraries\, schedulers and IO\, and container technologies. 
 </p> <p>Hardware HPC vendors and integrators will share their vision on 
 co-design\, while key people from the scientific software development 
 community will discuss the adoption of state-of-the-art technologies when 
 porting their codes on emerging computer architectures. Consequently\, the
  workshop will provide a rare and valuable opportunity to foster close 
 contacts and the exchange of ideas between the scientific and technical 
 communities.</p>

SUMMARY:Modeling Materials at Realistic time Scales via Optimal 
 Exploitation of Exascale Computers and Artificial Intelligence
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1442
DESCRIPTION:<p>The event is planned in terms of two stages: a high-level 
 CECAM workshop and a subsequent hands-on tutorial. Both activities address
  the concepts and implementations that are needed in order to link the 
 Quantum Mechanical (QM) description of electrons in materials\, to the 
 statistical mechanics principles that address the larger time and length 
 scales governing real-life situations.</p> <p>During the first 3 days\, 
 the workshop will focus on recent and important developments 
 addressing<strong> exascale scientific computing applications </strong>and
  related<strong> artificial intelligence (AI) methods\, </strong>with a 
 specific focus on urgent and critical aspects in the domain of 
 computational materials science. In particular\, we will address how 
 exascale computing can contribute to the enhanced performance of materials
  modeling\, in terms of higher accuracy\, precision and degree of inter-
 operability between different modeling length- and time-scales. These 
 technical aspects will be <strong>presented and discussed by leading 
 experts in different domains</strong>\, thus giving the opportunity to 
 explore similarities and differences in the various current state-of-the-
 art approaches towards exascale computing\, as well as the management of 
 modeling workflows and corresponding output data of interesting materials 
 properties.</p> <p>Then the following 2 days will consist of tutorials and
  hands-on demonstrations that will focus on recent progress in (1) first 
 principles simulations and (2) advanced sampling methods and software\, 
 and (3) the coupling of first principles molecular dynamics simulations 
 and advanced sampling methods. In particular\, examples using the <a 
 href="http://qboxcode.org/">Qbox</a> code coupled with with the <a 
 href="https://ssagesproject.github.io/">SSAGES suite of codes</a> and <a 
 href="http://ipi-code.org/">I-Pi</a> will be discussed in detail\, with 
 several hands-on examples.</p> <h3>General Scope</h3> <p>Real materials 
 are not necessarily in thermal equilibrium\, and a careful understanding 
 of the micro-structure of any material (e.g. grains and grain boundaries) 
 is crucial for the estimation of important materials properties and 
 functions. Thus\, QM techniques have necessarily to be connected to 
 molecular mechanics (MM)\, large-scale molecular dynamics (MD)\, kinetic 
 Monte Carlo (kMC)\, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD)\, just to name 
 a few methodologies. Very importantly\, we need robust connections between
  all such modelling techniques\, including a detailed understanding of the
  various errors and uncertainties involved. Moreover\, in order to 
 properly interpret the corresponding results\, we need all such inter-
 connections to be fully reversible\, i.e. not just able to transition from
  small to large scales but also conversely.</p> <p>The Handbook of 
 Materials Modeling (2005) is one of the main classical references in this 
 domain of scientific computing [1]\, and its 2nd edition has since 
 appeared in 2020 [2]. This has now turned into a six-volume major review 
 masterwork\, reflecting the significant developments in all aspects 
 pertaining to computational materials research over the past decade or 
 so\, including major progress in the formulation of increasingly realistic
  multi-scale modeling approaches\, workflows and models. However\, two 
 recent innovations in materials modeling applications are still relatively
  poorly and sparsely covered in the currently available review 
 literature\, namely <strong>exascale computing</strong> and related 
 <strong>artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods</strong>. These two 
 topics will be the main focus of our attention within our proposed 
 workshop and associated tutorial school.</p> <p>[1] Handbook of Materials

 Yip (eds)\, ISBN 978-3319788760\, Springer\, Cham</p> <h3>Format</h3> 
 <p>The event will start with a <strong>high-level workshop (3 
 days)</strong>. Talks\, discussions\, and poster sessions will be held as 
 a<strong> regular meeting involving the physical presence of all 
 participants</strong> (some but very few talks may be presented 
 virtually).</p> <p>Each of the five main sessions during the first part of
  the workshop (throughout the first three days) will start with an 
 <strong>introduction (15 minutes)</strong> by a renowned scientist\, the 
 so-called <strong>“moderator”</strong> for that particular session. The 
 subsequent talks in the corresponding session will then last for 
 <strong>30 minutes each</strong>\, and will be followed in turn by 
 <strong>10 minutes of general Q&amp\;A discussion</strong>.</p> <p>The 
 <strong>following 2-day hands-on tutorial</strong> will include coupling

SUMMARY:ONLINE Numerical methods for Large Eddy Simulation
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1339
DESCRIPTION:<p>The <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> code is a 
 parallel code of fluid mechanics that solves compressible Navier-Stokes 
 equations for laminar and turbulent reactive flows\, in 2D and 3D\, on 
 unstructured and hybrid meshes\, with third order Taylor Galerkin schemes.
  The resolution of these equations is based on the Large Eddy Simulation 
 (or Large Eddy Simulation) approach. Reduced chemical kinetics according 
 to the Arrhenius law coupled to the TFLES model for sub-grid flame-
 turbulence interactions make possible to treat combustion phenomena. <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> can also 
 calculate two-phase flows using a Lagrangian or Eulerian solver. <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> applies to 
 aeronautical combustion chambers\, turbomachinery\, industrial furnaces 
 and safety issues\, it allows for example to evaluate polluting emissions 
 (CO\, NOx and soot)\, to treat thermo-acoustic instabilities or detonation
  phenomena. <a href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> 
 is a world-famous code in the field of combustion\, used by many 
 laboratories (IMFT in Toulouse\, EM2C in Centralesupelec\, TU Munich\, Von

SUMMARY:Virtual course on free energy calculation and alchemical 
 transformation in GROMACS
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1455
DESCRIPTION:<p><strong>Overview</strong>: Are you interested in computing 
 free energy using alchemical transformations? Here we give an introduction
  to free energy calculation in <a 
 href="http://www.gromacs.org/">GROMACS</a>. In this course\, we focus on 
 two methods to calculate the free energy associated with an alchemical 
 transformation: Bennett acceptance ratio method (BAR) and accelerated 
 weighted histogram (AWH). The tutorials are implemented in Jupyter 
 notebook and cover how to perform a simple alchemical transformation and 
 compute the associated free energy change (e.i solvation free energy) 
 using the two approaches in GROMACS </p> <p><strong>Audience: 
 </strong>These sessions are aimed at people interested in:<br> 1) Starting
  to compute free energy using GROMACS.<br> 2) Understanding the difference
  between the approaches available in GROMACS for alchemical 
 transformation. </p> <p><strong>Pre-requisites: </strong>A minimum 
 knowledge of thermodynamics and minimum expertise in using GROMACS to 
 perform Molecular Dynamics calculation are needed to attend the training. 
 Moreover\, minimum Linux skills are also required. Please consult the 
 following materials\, if you’re uncertain of your Linux\, GROMACS and 
 Jupyter notebook skills:</p> <ul> <li>GROMACS <a 
 href="https://tutorials.gromacs.org/md-intro-tutorial.html#">tutorial</a>

SUMMARY:Optimizing Digital Teaching and Communication
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1370
DESCRIPTION:<p>In September 2021 we will hold a hands-on workshop on 
 e-learning techniques and strategies\, under the aegis of CECAM\, Psi-k 
 and the MaX (Material Design at Exascale) European Center of Excellence\, 
 aimed at teachers and researchers in electronic structure and HPC in 
 general.</p> <p>Join us!</p> <p>In this new world after the pandemic\, 
 experience and needs of those preparing online teaching have evolved. 
 Therefore\, we are organizing a hands-on workshop on online and blended 
 teaching\, that addresses the needs of the post-Covid era. There are 
 plenty of reasons to keep elements of teaching in an online form 
 permanently. </p> <p>Some workshop objectives are:</p> <ul> <li> How can 
 we learn from the past year? </li> <li> How can we <strong>offer our 
 online</strong> and blended <strong>teaching</strong> in a way that leads 
 <strong>to better learning and increased student satisfaction</strong>? 
 </li> <li> What are the <strong>pitfalls we must avoid</strong>? </li> 
 </ul> <p>We’ve set ourselves the challenge to bring this information to 
 you in an online format that will keep you engaged and motivated.</p> <ul>
  <li> You will <strong>leave the workshop with a set of online teaching 
 materials you will have prepared</strong>\, for your own courses\, talks 
 or science communication. </li> <li> You will not have the chance to hide 
 yourself anonymously behind your laptop\, and you <strong>will learn how 
 to avoid the same for your students or your audience.</strong> </li> </ul>
  <p>If you participate in this online workshop\, you may expect:</p> 
 <p>First a short self-paced online preparation course\, which you can take
  at any time between mid-August and mid-September 2021 (duration: 2-4 
 hours). Here you will learn the very basics\, and you will be guided to 
 set up the soft- and hardware you will need during the workshop (e.g. 
 video editing software\, polling tools\, ...).</p> <p>Four 3-hour live 
 online sessions spread from September 15 to September 22 (a detailed 
 timing will follow). During and after every session (yes\, there will be 
 home-work !) you will work on several tasks\, in small teams together with
  other participants.</p> <p>After September 22\, you will be given a 
 larger task that deals with a topic of your choice (e.g. something you 
 will need to teach about at your institute\, or a lecture you will have to
  give\, or simply a science topic you like). You will work on this for one
  week\, in interaction with a small team of other participants.</p> <p>On 
 October 1\, there is a final 3-hour online session where you will see what
  (some of) the other participants accomplished\, and where you will get 
 collective feedback as well as peer feedback on your work. </p> <p>If you 
 are interested to participate\, you should register in two different steps
  (both steps are mandatory):</p> <p>Step 1: register at CECAM<a

SUMMARY:ONLINE Training on Nek5000 @ENCCS/EXCELLERAT
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/856
DESCRIPTION:<p>In this one-day training\, we will give an overview of the 
 capabilities and features of Nek5000\, together with a hands-on session to
  install\, run and postprocess some comparably simple flow cases. Nek5000 
 is a spectral-element based solver for CFD\, and is available as an open 
 source package. The code has become popular among researchers worldwide\, 
 mainly because of its relatively high accuracy per grid point\, its 
 parallel efficiency and the wide user community and available packages 
 (e.g. statistics\, linear stability\, adjoints etc.).</p> <p>The 
 development of the various methods goes back to the mid 80s\, and a number
  of different approaches is now implemented\, both when it comes to the 
 integration of Navier-Stokes\, the communication kernels and efficient 
 single-core performance. There are also advanced capabilities when it 
 comes to meshing\, turbulence models\, moving meshes that make Nek5000 
 attractive even for more industrially relevant flows. The benefit of high 
 order and efficient parallelisation is clearly a distinguishing feature in
  situations when high fidelity simulation data is required.</p>

SUMMARY:First-principles simulations of materials with SIESTA
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1369
DESCRIPTION:<p>The school is aimed at students and researchers from 
 different disciplines who already use\, or plan to use\, first-principles 
 techniques to simulate properties of matter at the atomic scale. In 
 particular\, the school will focus on the SIESTA method [1\,2]. 
 Participants will learn its essential theoretical foundations\, and how to
  use the SIESTA code effectively. Pre- and post-processing tools will also
  be presented. The format of the school (completely online) allows for a 
 flexible offering of modules of different levels\, from basic to 
 advanced\, so that participants can adapt their syllabus. In addition\, 
 the material prepared for the school will be integrated into the corpus of
  SIESTA documentation\, which will remain available for continuous 
 learning.</p> <p><strong>FORMAT</strong></p> <p>The School will be 
 formally held in the week of June 28 -- July 2nd\, 2021\, but the week 
 before participants are expected to watch pre-recorded lectures\, prepare 
 their local computer setup [3]\, and work on simple exercises. Throughout 
 the School week\, live meetings will be offered in two tracks (morning and
  afternoon in Central-European Summer Time) to try to adapt to an audience
  distributed over different time zones\, and will consist of reviews of 
 relevant concepts (with Q&amp\;A sections) and guided hands-on 
 exercises.</p> <p>An online support forum will be open before\, during\, 
 and for some time after the canonical school dates to provide further 
 guidance\, to answer questions\, and to facilitate discussions between 
 school students and tutors.</p> <p><strong>COURSE MATERIALS</strong></p> 
 <p>The materials for the school will consist of:</p> <ul> <li>Pre-recorded
  video lectures covering the necessary theoretical background and/or how-
 to's for specific features.</li> <li>An online repository of documentation
  and how-to guides.</li> <li>A virtual machine or container\, based on the
  Quantum Mobile [3]\, packaged with the necessary codes and supporting 
 school files\, for the hands-on exercises.</li> </ul> 
 <p><strong>PROGRAM</strong></p> <p>The live sessions of the school will 
 take place from 09:30 to 12:30 CEST (Track A) and from 16:00 to 19:00 CEST
  (Track B)\, with breaks. It is expected that two modules will be covered 
 in each session.</p> <p>Background lectures and hands-on modules will 
 cover an assortment of topics\, from basic and fundamental to advanced. 
 Students focusing on basic to medium level topics will be able to work on 
 the relevant modules throughout the school. More advanced students will be
  able to prepare their own selection of topics.</p> <p>(Please check <a 
 href="https://siesta-project.org/siesta/events/SIESTA_School-2021/">this 
 page</a> for updates and further details.)</p> 
 <p><strong>REGISTRATION</strong></p> <p>Persons interested in registering 
 for the School need to <strong>submit two registration forms</strong>. 
 </p> <p>First\, they must apply through the “Participate” tab of<a 
 href="https://members.cecam.org/login"> the CECAM web page</a>. </p> 
 <p>Second\, they need to submit the online form at <a href="https://forms.
 office.com/r/BQYpMkku4V">https://forms.office.com/r/BQYpMkku4V</a> using 
 the same email address that they provided to CECAM.</p> <p>Apart from 
 basic identification and affiliation data\, prospective students will be 
 asked to provide a brief statement of motivation\, a very brief CV (one 
 paragraph)\, and indications of preferences for topics. <strong>Please 
 submit both forms\, persons who only apply through one of the two forms 
 will not be accepted</strong> to the school.</p> <p>For practical reasons 
 the school is organized to handle only a finite number of students in the 
 live sessions\, hence we must limit the number of officially registered 
 participants. Nevertheless\, the material and some forum channels will be 
 available at a later date also for those not officially admitted to the 
 school.</p> <p>The deadline for applications is the <strong>4th June 
 2021</strong>. We will communicate our acceptance decisions by the 11th 
 June. Accepted participants will be given access to the materials starting
  on the 21st June.</p> <h2>References</h2> <p>[1] José M Soler\, Emilio

SUMMARY:ONLINE COURSE: From Machine Learning to Deep Learning: a concise 
 introduction
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/857
DESCRIPTION:<p>This HLRS course addresses students\, data scientists\, and 
 researchers who would like to have an introduction to Machine and Deep 
 Learning methods to solve challenging and future-oriented problems. Both 
 Machine and Deep Learning methods and examples will be presented\, 
 together with their implementation on HLRS systems. The first part will be
  an introduction to basic methods in Machine Learning\, including pre-
 processing and supervised learning using Apache Spark. The course will 
 then move on to elements of supervised Deep Learning on real data to 
 classify annotated images of waste in the wild. Given the deluge of 
 information needed to power machine and deep learning methods\, it is 
 imperative to think about effective data processing strategies. 
 Therefore\, the course will conclude with an introduction to data 
 compression using the BigWhoop library (part of the <a 
 href="https://www.excellerat.eu/viewcode/9">EXCELLERAT Data Exchange and 
 Workflow Portal</a>). As an efficient data reduction tool\, BigWhoop can 
 be applied to generic numerical datasets to minimize I/O bottlenecks and 
 optimize data storage. The lectures are interleaved with many hands-on 
 sessions using Jupyter Notebooks and scripts on HLRS systems.</p>

SUMMARY:Advanced school on Quantum Transport using SIESTA
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1374
DESCRIPTION:<p>This five-day online school will focus on the field of 
 theoretical condensed matter electronic transport exploiting the non-
 equilibrium Green’s function approach. In particular\, recent advances in 
 transport theory [1] will be presented in the form of lectures and hands-
 on sessions on hot topics in the field. The teachers will present novel 
 methods used for materials research modelling. The participants will learn
  the advanced features of SIESTA [2]\, such as the calculations of non-
 equilibrium properties using the TranSIESTA/TBtrans approach and the 
 python framework SISL [3]. For example\, the school lectures will cover a 
 recent scheme introducing truly single-junction transport calculations [4]
  and the new implementations to include in the transport calculations 
 different corrections to the Hamiltonian accounting for electron-phonon 
 coupling [5]\, spin orbit coupling and electronic correlation. Moreover\, 
 the users will learn how to extract a tight-binding Hamiltonian from a DFT
  Hamiltonian allowing them to deal with very large systems [6\,7].</p> 
 <p>The lectures will take place via Zoom with an invited list of speakers 
 who will present their work in a variety of fields in which the covered 
 tools have been used. Each topic will be followed by a hands-on session 
 allowing participants first-hand experience with the tools and 
 analysis.</p> <p>While this is an open workshop (for everybody!)\, we ask 
 participants to sign-up due to content distribution prior to the workshop 
 itself.</p> <p>The workshop will also host 2 evenings with online poster 
 sessions\, and all participants are expected to present their research in 
 one of the two sessions.</p> <p><strong>The deadline for the abstract

 tutorial">https://github.com/zerothi/ts-tbt-sisl-tutorial</a></p> 
 <p><strong>Detailed School Topics:</strong></p> <p><em>Advanced usage of 
 SIESTA\, TranSIESTA/TBtrans and sisl</em></p> <p>Participants will learn 
 how to use the advanced features implemented in the aforementioned code 
 and python framework. In particular students will be taught how to perform
  efficient DFT+NEGF calculations\, pre-processing\, post-processing 
 analysis and data visualization.</p> <p><em>Electrochemistry</em></p> 
 <p>First principles simulations are now crucial in many areas of materials
  science. However\, this has not yet reached the field of 
 electrochemistry\, where the complexity of the electrochemical environment
  and the presence of the external electrode potential are difficulties 
 that have precluded direct application of the usual first-principles 
 methods like DFT. We will explain how some of these problems\, like the 
 presence of the electrostatic potential\, can be tackled using 
 TranSIESTA.</p> <p><em>Topological Insulators</em></p> <p>Topological 
 insulators (TI) are a phase of matter characterized by a bulk energy gap 
 and conducting surface (or edge) states symmetry-protected against small 
 perturbations. Quantum transport simulations are crucial to compute and 
 validate the topological properties of materials. We will show how SIESTA 
 can be used to predict the essential features of topological materials\, 
 leveraging on the recent Spin-Orbit Coupling implementation and SISL.</p> 
 <p><em>Inelastic transport</em></p> <p>The modelling of inelastic effects 
 due to the electron-phonon coupling in nano-scale devices is of great 
 technological importance as it impacts both the transport properties and 
 Joule heating. It is especially challenging to include the effects in 
 large-scale atomistic first principles device simulations. We will discuss
  how this can be addressed using various approximations and introduce the 
 Inelastica package (<a href="https://github.com/tfrederiksen/inelastica/">
 https://github.com/tfrederiksen/inelastica/</a>) based on TranSIESTA.</p> 
 <p><em>Correlated systems and the meanfield Hubbard model</em></p> 
 <p>Coulomb repulsion between electrons can lead to unpaired electron 
 states and interesting spin structures. For graphene-like nanostructures 
 the meanfield Hubbard model provides a simple and\, yet\, often sufficient
  method to understand how electronic interactions lead to magnetism. We 
 will describe an implementation of this model based on SISL.</p> 
 <p><em>Single contacts by removal of periodic images</em></p> 
 <p>Understanding transport properties under non-equilibrium is of vital 
 importance to the development of next-generation electronics. A basic 
 principle of conducting such simulations is by using Bloch’s theorem which
  has the disadvantage of adding a periodic image of the junction. We will 
 present how users can overcome this limitation and simulate truly single 
 junctions.</p> <p><em>Modelling of extremely large-systems with DFT 
 precision</em></p> <p>Recent increase in compute power is rapidly 
 decreasing the gap between experimental and theoretical works. This allows
  theoreticians to study one-to-one samples matching an exact experiment. 
 However\, there is still some way to go in terms of scalability and 
 precision. Here we present a method to extract the important part of a 
 Hamiltonian in an energy window allowing simulations of transport 
 properties of even larger systems by retaining the band-structure without 
 using any wannierization techniques.</p> <h2>References</h2> <p>[1] N.

 pertinent to HPC such as coarrays, do concurrent, and improved 
 interoperability with C in the 2018 standard. This webinar will also 
 discuss GPU programming in CUDA and OpenACC as well as the MPI 2018 
 bindings that use derived data types. The webinar will discuss recent 
 attempts to revive Fortran and encourage the community to be more involved
  in the future of the language via the <a href="https://fortran-
 lang.org/">new website</a>.</p></BODY></HTML>

SUMMARY:Workshop on High-performance Data Analytics @ENCCS/HiDALGO
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/869
DESCRIPTION:<h2>General description and learning outcomes</h2> <p>We would 
 like to invite you to participate in our High-performance data analytics 
 course where we will introduce different tools and methods for Big data 
 handling. The tools will be presented on two different use cases but can 
 be applied to any data.</p> <p>HiDALGO (<a href="https://hidalgo-
 project.eu/">https://hidalgo-project.eu/</a>) – HPC and Big Data 
 Technologies for Global Systems – is a European project funded by the 
 Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union. The project is 
 carried out by 13 institutions from seven countries. <br>  This training 
 event will start with an introductory talk to provide a view of high-
 performance data analytics (HPDA) from the HiDALGO perspective. The main 
 concepts will be presented\, listing the tools that have been used\, 
 together with information about benchmarks the consortium has done (as a 
 source of information about their scalability). This introduction also 
 presents how these tools are being applied in HiDALGO\, in order to solve 
 different problems.<br>  The following part of the training will focus on 
 HPC and HPDA technologies\, applied to use-cases such as Urban Air 
 Pollution (UAP). The UAP application is a software framework for modeling 
 the vehicular traffic emitted air pollution and its dispersion at very 
 high resolution by using geometry inputs (Open Street Map)\, coupled 
 weather data (ECMWF) and traffic simulation (SUMO)\, computational fluid 
 dynamics (CFD) tools running on HPC infrastructures (OpenFOAM)\, and 
 evaluation with HPDA methods.<br>  This HPC/HPDA/UAP-part of the training 
 will introduce the UAP concept\, workflows\, implementations\, application
  of the CFD-module in HPC environment\, deployment to HPC\, running\, and 
 evaluation. Participants will learn the techniques of these parts from a 
 general perspective\, namely\, HPC workflow modeling (TOSCA in YAML 
 rendering)\, basics of OpenFOAM for computation of air pollutant 
 dispersion using HPC\, and the applied HPDA methods for fast 
 evaluation.<br>  The last part will provide an introduction to the data 
 available at ECMWF and Copernicus\, and the APIs for retrieving the data\,
  followed by practical sessions on data exploration and manipulation. 
 After this web-seminar\, participants will be able to independently 
 discover weather\, climate\, and environmental data produced and hosted by
  ECMWF\, and also to retrieve and process these data using Python 
 libraries.</p> <h2>For whom is the workshop</h2> <p>Researchers\, 
 practitioners\, and developers who are interested in implementation of HPC
  workflows and HPDA. Environmental scientists that would like to apply 
 microscale models and exploit the strength of HPC easily.</p> <p>The part 
 provided by ECMWF is aimed in particular at researchers that would like to
  use weather\, climate\, or environmental data in their work.</p> 
 <h2>Prerequisites</h2> <ul> <li>Participants are expected to have some 
 basic knowledge about Big Data technologies (although not mandatory).</li>
  <li>Participants need to have basic knowledge of Linux CLI for the 
 developer parts of the UAP training. For the application side\, basic 
 environmental knowledge related to air pollution needed (although not 
 mandatory).</li> <li>For the part related to weather\, participants are 
 expected to have basic Python knowledge and be comfortable using Jupyter 
 Notebooks. They will have the option to either use the mybinder.org 
 platform or work locally. The github repository with the notebooks and a 
 list of libraries will be provided before the workshop.</li> </ul>

SUMMARY:QM/MM with GROMACS + CP2K
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1458
DESCRIPTION:<p><strong>Learning outcomes</strong><br> This course will 
 equip participants to perform hybrid QM/MM simulations using the molecular
  dynamics code GROMACS in combination with the quantum chemistry package 
 CP2K through an interface developed by one of the instructors from the 
 BioExcel Centre of Excellence (www.bioexcel.eu).</p> 
 <p><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br> Participants should be familiar with
  using GROMACS to perform molecular dynamics simulations. A background in 
 computational quantum chemistry is not strictly required since an 
 introduction of key aspects will be provided\, but previous familiarity is
  beneficial. You should be familiar with connecting to a remote machine 
 using ssh and will benefit from experience using an HPC facility as you 
 will execute hands-on practicals on the UK supercomputer ARCHER2.</p> 
 <p><strong>Description</strong><br> Most classical molecular mechanics 
 (MM) force fields are not sufficiently flexible to model processes in 
 which chemical bonds are broken or formed. Instead\, some level of quantum
  mechanical (QM) description is needed to gain detailed mechanistic 
 insights into reaction mechanisms\, e.g. the catalytic action of enzymes\,
  and to compute photochemical properties such as absorption and emission 
 spectra of fluorescent proteins. However biochemical systems (including 
 solvent) are too large to be solved in their entirety at ab initio QM 
 level or efficiently even with a high-quality density functional theory 
 (DFT) approximation. To overcome the cost of a QM description on the one 
 hand versus the limitations of a MM treatment on the other hand\, methods 
 have been developed that treat a small critical region of interest at QM 
 level while retaining the computationally cheaper MM force field for the 
 majority of the system.</p> <p>Despite the simplicity of the QM/MM 
 concept\, its application is currently restricted to a relatively small 
 group of specialised expert users often using in-house codes. To unlock 
 the power of QM/MM simulations for the wider biomolecular simulation 
 community\, the BioExcel Centre of Excellence has developed an interface 
 between the molecular dynamics code GROMACS\, which is widely used in the 
 biomolecular simulation community\, and the quantum chemistry package 
 CP2K\, which supports calculations under periodic boundary conditions with
  DFT methods.</p> <p>This course explains key aspects relating to the use 
 of QM/MM for biomolecular simulation with these two codes and equips 
 participants with the ability to start using GROMACS and CP2K for this 
 purpose in their own research. Participants are provided with the 
 opportunity to gain hands-on practical experience running several example 
 calculations on ARCHER2\, the UK national supercomputing service.</p>

SUMMARY:Reproducible Software Environments & Benchmarks with Ansible and 
 Spack: HiDALGO approach
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/868
DESCRIPTION:<p>A talk will be given by Sergiy Gogolenko at HLRS (HiDALGO 
 partner) on simplifying user software installation on versatile 
 clusters/testbeds\, as well as creating reproducible software environments
  and benchmarks with Spack and Ansible for HiDALGO and HLRS-SANE 
 teams.</p> <p>Abstract:<br>  In recent decades\, there is a tendency to 
 pay solid attention to reproducibility of experiments in science. In many 
 cases\, reproducibility becomes one of the corner-stone measures (or even 
 pre-requisite for publication) of the high quality research. In terms of 
 HPC\, reproducibility of benchmarks presumes exhaustive reports of the 
 hardware and software setup\, as well as an easy and consistent way to 
 replicate the software environment in use.<br>  Unfortunately\, the users 
 of HPC clusters and testbeds face with a number of obstacles on the way to
  prepare reproducible software environments. In particular\, each data 
 center provides its own subset of pre-installed software and has a set of 
 specific policies and restrictions (like lack of access to internet). 
 Moreover\, in order to reach better performance\, the end-user usually 
 must install the software from sources watching all its dependencies\, 
 which demands an unnecessarily high level of technical expertise. As a 
 results\, installation often becomes a tedious time-consuming process 
 discouraging people from taking care of software reproducibility 
 particularly and from HPC generally.<br>  Spack is a HPC-oriented package 
 manager\, which solves most of the above-mentioned problems if configured 
 correctly\, while Ansible addresses the issue of deploying and configuring
  Spack with off-line mirrors for the end-users. In addition\, Ansible and 
 Spack feature deep integration of YAML and JSON formats along with a high 
 extensibility via a wide range of builtin and external modules. It makes 
 these tools a perfect combination not only for automated fully-
 reproducible software installation\, but also for documenting hardware and
  software configurations along with the installation process uniformly in 
 a human readable format easy to post-process.<br>  The purpose of this 
 talk is largely to teach basics of configuring and using Spack for the 
 end-users of HPC systems\, as well as to introduce an Ansible+Spack 
 solution which we use for automated installation of the same software on a
  variety of clusters.<br>  Tentative agenda:<br>  - Introduction to Spack 
 and Ansible (5min)<br> - Spack from user prospective: basic usage 
 (10min)<br> - Configuring Spack (15 min)<br> - Deployment of Spack on 
 versatile hardware with Ansible (10min)<br> - Reproducible benchmarks and

SUMMARY:All electron DFT with Fleur - a Hands-on Tutorial
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1371
DESCRIPTION:<p>The density-functional theory (DFT) in its various 
 incarnation provides the most practical framework to compute basic 
 electronic\, magnetic\, and structural properties of materials. Large 
 scale materials screening using DFT is believed to be a key factor in 
 future materials development. The full-potential linearized augmented 
 planewave (FLAPW) method has emerged as a robust and precise state-of-the-
 art technique with reasonable computational efficiency. It is widely 
 accepted as providing the reference solution. However\, the use and 
 application of DFT methods and of FLAPW in particular require a thorough 
 training where users meet developers of such methods.</p> <p>Hence this 
 tutorial focuses on training the participants in using our all-electron 
 FLAPW DFT code <a href="http://www.flapw.de/">FLEUR</a>. A special focus 
 will be on the usage of FLEUR within the AiiDA infrastructure to build 
 automatic work-flows applicable to materials screening applications.</p> 
 <p>The tutorial covers theoretical lectures to provide the necessary 
 methodological and physical background to professionally use the FLEUR 
 code family and enable the participants to benefit from the strengths of 
 the codes. Hands-on sessions are provided to get in touch with the codes 
 from a practical perspective.</p> <p>Our school will consist of lectures 
 covering three main areas:</p> <ul> <li>the underlying basic theory\,</li>
  <li>the installation and usage of FLEUR and its <a 
 href="http://www.aiida.net/">AiiDA</a> interface\,</li> <li>more

SUMMARY:ONLINE Numerical methods for Large Eddy Simulation
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/860
DESCRIPTION:<p>The <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> code is a 
 parallel code of fluid mechanics that solves compressible Navier-Stokes 
 equations for laminar and turbulent reactive flows\, in 2D and 3D\, on 
 unstructured and hybrid meshes\, with third order Taylor Galerkin schemes.
  The resolution of these equations is based on the Large Eddy Simulation 
 (or Large Eddy Simulation) approach. Reduced chemical kinetics according 
 to the Arrhenius law coupled to the TFLES model for sub-grid flame-
 turbulence interactions make possible to treat combustion phenomena. <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> can also 
 calculate two-phase flows using a Lagrangian or Eulerian solver. <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> applies to 
 aeronautical combustion chambers\, turbomachinery\, industrial furnaces 
 and safety issues\, it allows for example to evaluate polluting emissions 
 (CO\, NOx and soot)\, to treat thermo-acoustic instabilities or detonation
  phenomena. <a href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> 
 is a world-famous code in the field of combustion\, used by many 
 laboratories (IMFT in Toulouse\, EM2C in Centralesupelec\, TU Munich\, Von
  Karmann Institute\, ETH Zurich\, etc.) and in industry (SAFRAN AIRCRAFT 
 ENGINES\, SAFRAN HELICOPTER ENGINES\, ARIANEGROUP\, HERAKLES\, TOTAL\, 
 etc.).</p>

 The resolution of these equations is based on the Large Eddy Simulation 
 (or Large Eddy Simulation) approach. Reduced chemical kinetics according 
 to the Arrhenius law coupled to the TFLES model for sub-grid flame-
 turbulence interactions make possible to treat combustion phenomena. <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> can also 
 calculate two-phase flows using a Lagrangian or Eulerian solver. <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> applies to 
 aeronautical combustion chambers, turbomachinery, industrial furnaces and 
 safety issues, it allows for example to evaluate polluting emissions (CO, 
 NOx and soot), to treat thermo-acoustic instabilities or detonation 
 phenomena. <a href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/5">AVBP</a> is
  a world-famous code in the field of combustion, used by many laboratories
  (IMFT in Toulouse, EM2C in Centralesupelec, TU Munich, Von Karmann 
 Institute, ETH Zurich, etc.) and in industry (SAFRAN AIRCRAFT ENGINES, 
 SAFRAN HELICOPTER ENGINES, ARIANEGROUP, HERAKLES, TOTAL,

SUMMARY:Extended Software Development Workshop in HPC for mesoscale 
 simulation
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/971
DESCRIPTION:<p>Mesoscale simulations have grown recently in importance due 
 to their capacity of capturing molecular and atomistic effects without 
 having to solve for a prohibitively large number of particles needed in 
 Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations. Different approaches\, emerging from a
  coarse approximation to a group of atoms and molecules\, allow 
 reproducing both chemical and physical main properties as well as 
 continuum behaviour such as the hydrodynamics of fluid flows.</p> <p>One 
 of the most common techniques is the Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD): 
 an approximate\, coarse-grain\, mesoscale simulation method for 
 investigating phenomena between the atomic and the continuum scale world\,
  like flows through complex geometries\, micro fluids\, phase behaviours 
 and polymer processing. It consists of an off-lattice\, discrete particle 
 method similar to MD but with replacement of a soft potential for the 
 conservative force\, a random force to simulate the Brownian motion of the
  particles and a drag force to balance the random force and conserve the 
 total momentum of the system.</p> <p>However\, real applications usually 
 consist of a large number of particles and despite the coarse grain 
 approximation\, compared to MD\, High Performance Computing (HPC) is often
  required for simulating systems of industrial and scientific interest. On
  the other hand\, today’s hardware is quickly moving towards hybrid CPU-
 GPU architectures. In fact\, five of the top ten supercomputer are made of
  mixed CPU and NVidia GPU accelerators which allow to achieve hundreds of 
 PetaFlops performance. This type of architecture is also one of the main 
 paths toward Exascale.</p> <p>Few software\, like DL_MESO\, userMESO and 
 LAMMPS\, can currently simulate large DPD simulations. In particular\, 
 DL_MESO has recently been ported to multi-GPU architectures and runs 
 efficiently up to 4096 GPUs. This allows investigating very large system 
 with billions of particles within affordable computational effort. 
 However\, additional effort is required to enable the current version to 
 cover more complex physics\, like long range forces as well as achieving 
 higher parallel computing efficiency.</p> <p>The purpose of this Extended 
 Software Development Workshop (ESDW) is to introduce students to the 
 parallel programming of hybrid CPU-GPU systems. The intention is not only 
 to port mesoscale solvers on GPUs\, but also to expose the community to 
 this new programming paradigm\, which they can benefit from in their own 
 fields of research. See more details about the topics covered by this ESDW

 capturing molecular and atomistic effects without having to solve for a 
 prohibitively large number of particles needed in Molecular Dynamic (MD) 
 simulations. Different approaches, emerging from a coarse approximation to
  a group of atoms and molecules, allow reproducing both chemical and 
 physical main properties as well as continuum behaviour such as the 
 hydrodynamics of fluid flows.</p> <p>One of the most common techniques is 
 the Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD): an approximate, coarse-grain, 
 mesoscale simulation method for investigating phenomena between the atomic
  and the continuum scale world, like flows through complex geometries, 
 micro fluids, phase behaviours and polymer processing. It consists of an 
 off-lattice, discrete particle method similar to MD but with replacement 
 of a soft potential for the conservative force, a random force to simulate
  the Brownian motion of the particles and a drag force to balance the 
 random force and conserve the total momentum of the system.</p> 
 <p>However, real applications usually consist of a large number of 
 particles and despite the coarse grain approximation, compared to MD, High
  Performance Computing (HPC) is often required for simulating systems of 
 industrial and scientific interest. On the other hand, today’s hardware is
  quickly moving towards hybrid CPU-GPU architectures. In fact, five of the
  top ten supercomputer are made of mixed CPU and NVidia GPU accelerators 
 which allow to achieve hundreds of PetaFlops performance. This type of 
 architecture is also one of the main paths toward Exascale.</p> <p>Few 
 software, like DL_MESO, userMESO and LAMMPS, can currently simulate large 
 DPD simulations. In particular, DL_MESO has recently been ported to multi-
 GPU architectures and runs efficiently up to 4096 GPUs. This allows 
 investigating very large system with billions of particles within 
 affordable computational effort. However, additional effort is required to
  enable the current version to cover more complex physics, like long range
  forces as well as achieving higher parallel computing efficiency.</p> 
 <p>The purpose of this Extended Software Development Workshop (ESDW) is to
  introduce students to the parallel programming of hybrid CPU-GPU systems.
  The intention is not only to port mesoscale solvers on GPUs, but also to 
 expose the community to this new programming paradigm, which they can 
 benefit from in their own fields of research. See more details about the 
 topics covered by this ESDW under tab “Program”.</p> <p>References</p>

SUMMARY:Practical introduction to QM/MM using CP2K for biomolecular 
 modelling
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1463
DESCRIPTION:<p>As a collaboration between ARCHER2 Training and BioExcel\, 
 this free online course consists of interactive hands-on practical 
 sessions presented remotely using Collaborate. Attendees will be given 
 access to ARCHER to execute the practical.</p> <p>The course will run over
  two Tuesday afternoons\, 13th and 20th October. Participants are expected
  to attend both sessions. Each session will run from 13:30-16:00 with a 
 break 14:30-15:00. There will be a follow-up consultancy session\, where 
 you can drop-in to ask questions of the tutor on Tuesday 3rd November 
 14:00-16:00</p> <h3>Outline</h3> <p>CP2K is a quantum chemistry and solid 
 state physics software package that can perform atomistic simulations of a
  wide variety of systems\, ranging from solid state to biological systems.
  CP2K provides a general framework for running density functional theory 
 (DFT) simulations\, with extensions that enable users to run classical 
 molecular dynamics (MD)\, mix MD and DFT to obtain quantum-
 mechanical/molecular-dynamics (QM/MM) runs\, or perform other forms of 
 metadynamics\, Monte Carlo\, or other simulations.</p> <p>This course is 
 aiming to teach attendees how to prepare and run biochemical simulations 
 in CP2K. Specifically\, we will be looking at how CP2K can be used to 
 track the reaction dynamics of a system undergoing biological catalysis. 
 In this course\, we shall be focusing on a Diels Alder transition taking 
 place in an immunoglobulin. We will begin by considering the reaction site
  in a purely quantum-mechanical method. Then\, we will slowly increase the
  complexity of the system to take into account the entire structure of the
  immunoglobulin (using QM/MM approach)\, the solution\, and finally\, we 
 will add a ligand to the reaction.</p> <p>While we will be referencing 
 some DFT and QM/MM theory (mainly the nudged elastic band method and 
 metadynamics)\, this is not the principal aim of this course. Our aim is 
 to use these systems to help familiarise attendees with using CP2K to run 
 simulations of biochemical systems. CP2K can be used for non-biological 
 systems\, and the topics being taught here can be ported to other fields\,
  but this will not be a primary focus of this course.</p> <h3>Learning 
 outcomes</h3> <p>At the end of this session\, you will be able to:</p> 
 <ul> <li>Run a geometry optimisation using CP2K</li> <li>Run a frequency 
 calculation using CP2K</li> <li>Estimate the energy barrier of a chemical 
 reaction</li> <li>Run a nudged elastic band (NEB) simulation to fine-tune 
 the energy barrier and profile of a chemical reaction</li> <li>Prepare a 
 QM/MM simulation for CP2K</li> <li>Run a QM/MM simulation in CP2K</li>

SUMMARY:AiiDA Virtual Tutorial
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1375
DESCRIPTION:<p>The goal of this 4 day-tutorial is to help students and 
 researchers from the field of computational materials science get started 
 with writing reproducible workflows. They will be introduced by experts in
  the field (including the developers of the code) to the use of AiiDA\, a 
 state-of-the-art framework for provenance tracking and workflow management
  designed to support high-throughput research\, and will gain in-depth 
 hands-on experience using a tool that they can directly apply to their own
  research. Participation both from academia and from industry is 
 encouraged.</p> <p>The AiiDA framework is a tool for workflow management 
 and provenance tracking\, which is backed by a significant community of 
 users and developers\, and has interfaces to more than 30 materials 
 science codes (see <a href="http://aiidateam.github.io/aiida-
 registry">plugin registry</a>)\, including (among others) to the ab initio
  codes Quantum ESPRESSO\, VASP\, cp2k\, Castep\, Siesta\, Fleur\, 
 Crystal\, NWChem\, Wannier90\, and Yambo. AiiDA’s permissive open source 
 license (MIT) enables participants to use it both in academic and 
 commercial settings. By virtue of its general design and flexible plugin 
 system\, AiiDA is easily extended to new codes and new use cases.</p> 
 <p>Talks will be pre-recorded and made available to participants before 
 the event\, and hands-on tutorials will be held <em>via</em> <a 
 href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>. In order to avoid losing time on 
 installation issues\, participants will have the option to connect to 
 virtual machines preconfigured with AiiDA (or to come with AiiDA already 
 installed on their laptop via the <a 
 href="https://www.materialscloud.org/work/quantum-mobile">Quantum Mobile 
 virtual machine</a>).</p> <p>The event will mostly focus on in-depth 
 tutorials on using AiiDA and on writing workflows. It will also include 
 some talks on how AiiDA has been already used in production\, given by the
  organisers and the core developers of AiiDA\; on advanced aspects of 
 workflow management\; on designing and writing new AiiDA plugins\; and on 
 research data management (RDM) and how to write data management plans 
 (DMPs)\, especially when using AiiDA and the <a 
 href="https://www.materialscloud.org/">Materials Cloud</a>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Speakers &amp\; organisers</strong></p> <p>The tutorial is 
 organised by <strong>Chris Sewell (EPFL\, CH)\, Marnik Bercx (EPFL\, CH)

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:<!DOCTYPE HTML><HTML><BODY><p>The goal of this
  4 day-tutorial is to help students and researchers from the field of 
 computational materials science get started with writing reproducible 
 workflows. They will be introduced by experts in the field (including the 
 developers of the code) to the use of AiiDA, a state-of-the-art framework 
 for provenance tracking and workflow management designed to support high-
 throughput research, and will gain in-depth hands-on experience using a 
 tool that they can directly apply to their own research. Participation 
 both from academia and from industry is encouraged.</p> <p>The AiiDA 
 framework is a tool for workflow management and provenance tracking, which
  is backed by a significant community of users and developers, and has 
 interfaces to more than 30 materials science codes (see <a 
 href="http://aiidateam.github.io/aiida-registry">plugin registry</a>), 
 including (among others) to the ab initio codes Quantum ESPRESSO, VASP, 
 cp2k, Castep, Siesta, Fleur, Crystal, NWChem, Wannier90, and Yambo. 
 AiiDA’s permissive open source license (MIT) enables participants to use 
 it both in academic and commercial settings. By virtue of its general 
 design and flexible plugin system, AiiDA is easily extended to new codes 
 and new use cases.</p> <p>Talks will be pre-recorded and made available to
  participants before the event, and hands-on tutorials will be held 
 <em>via</em> <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>. In order to avoid losing
  time on installation issues, participants will have the option to connect
  to virtual machines preconfigured with AiiDA (or to come with AiiDA 
 already installed on their laptop via the <a 
 href="https://www.materialscloud.org/work/quantum-mobile">Quantum Mobile 
 virtual machine</a>).</p> <p>The event will mostly focus on in-depth 
 tutorials on using AiiDA and on writing workflows. It will also include 
 some talks on how AiiDA has been already used in production, given by the 
 organisers and the core developers of AiiDA; on advanced aspects of 
 workflow management; on designing and writing new AiiDA plugins; and on 
 research data management (RDM) and how to write data management plans 
 (DMPs), especially when using AiiDA and the <a 
 href="https://www.materialscloud.org/">Materials Cloud</a>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Speakers &amp; organisers</strong></p> <p>The tutorial is 
 organised by <strong>Chris Sewell (EPFL, CH), Marnik Bercx (EPFL, CH)

SUMMARY:Integration of ESL modules into electronic-structure codes
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1376
DESCRIPTION:<p>The evolutionary pressure on electronic structure software 
 development is greatly increasing\, due to the emergence of new 
 paradigms\, new kinds of users\, new processes\, and new tools. Electronic
  structure software complexity is consequently also increasing\, requiring
  a larger effort on code maintenance. Developers of large electronic 
 structure codes are trying to relieve some complexity by transitioning 
 standardized algorithms into separate libraries [BigDFT-PSolver\, ELPA\, 
 ELSI\, LibXC\, LibGridXC\, etc.]. This paradigm shift requires library 
 developers to have a hybrid developer profile where the scientific and 
 computational skill set becomes equally important. These topics have been 
 extensively and publicly discussed between developers of various projects 
 including ABINIT\, ASE\, ATK\, BigDFT\, CASTEP\, FHI-aims\, GPAW\, 
 Octopus\, Quantum Espresso\, SIESTA\, and SPR-KKR.</p> <p>High-quality 
 standardized libraries are not only a highly challenging effort lying at 
 the hands of the library developers\, they also open possibilities for 
 codes to take advantage of a standard way to access commonly used 
 algorithms. Integration of these libraries\, however\, requires a 
 significant initial effort that is often sacrificed for new developments 
 that often not even reach the mainstream branch of the code. 
 Additionally\, there are multiple challenges in adopting new libraries 
 which have their roots in a variety of issues: installation\, data 
 structures\, physical units and parallelism - all of which are code-
 dependent. On the other hand\, adoption of common libraries ensures the 
 immediate propagation of improvements within the respective library’s 
 field of research and ensures codes are up-to-date with much less effort 
 [LibXC]. Indeed\, well-established libraries can have a huge impact on 
 multiple scientific communities at once [PETSc].</p> <p>In the Electronic 
 Structure community\, two issues are emerging. Libraries are being 
 developed [esl\, esl-gitlab] but require an ongoing commitment from the 
 community with respect to sharing the maintenance and development effort. 
 Secondly\, existing codes will benefit from libraries by adopting their 
 use. Both issues are mainly governed by the exposure of the libraries and 
 the availability of library core developers\, which are typically 
 researchers pressured by publication deliverables and fund-raising 
 burdens. They are thus not able to commit a large fraction of their time 
 to software development.</p> <p>An effort to allow code developers to make
  use of\, and develop\, shared components is needed. This requires an 
 efficient coordination between various elements:</p> <p>A common and 
 consistent code development infrastructure/education in terms of 
 compilation\, installation\, testing and documentation.<br> - How to use 
 and integrate already published libraries into existing projects.<br> - 
 Creating long-lasting synergies between developers to reach a “critical 
 mass” of component contributors.<br> - Relevant quality metrics ("TRLs" 
 and “SRLs”)\, to provide businesses with useful information .</p> <p>This 
 is what the Electronic Structure Library (ESL)[esl\, esl-gitlab] has been 
 doing since 2014\, with a wiki\, a data-exchange standard\, refactoring 
 code of global interest into integrated modules\, and regularly organizing
  workshops\, within a wider movement lead by the European eXtreme Data and
  Computing Initiative [exdci].</p> <p>References</p> <p>[BigDFT-PSolver]

 to software development.</p> <p>An effort to allow code developers to make
  use of, and develop, shared components is needed. This requires an 
 efficient coordination between various elements:</p> <p>A common and 
 consistent code development infrastructure/education in terms of 
 compilation, installation, testing and documentation.<br> - How to use and
  integrate already published libraries into existing projects.<br> - 
 Creating long-lasting synergies between developers to reach a “critical 
 mass” of component contributors.<br> - Relevant quality metrics ("TRLs" 
 and “SRLs”), to provide businesses with useful information .</p> <p>This 
 is what the Electronic Structure Library (ESL)[esl, esl-gitlab] has been 
 doing since 2014, with a wiki, a data-exchange standard, refactoring code 
 of global interest into integrated modules, and regularly organizing 
 workshops, within a wider movement lead by the European eXtreme Data and 
 Computing Initiative [exdci].</p> <p>References</p> <p>[BigDFT-PSolver] <a

SUMMARY:Computational biomolecular simulation workflows with BioExcel 
 building blocks
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1473
DESCRIPTION:<p><strong>Overview</strong></p> <p>Are you interested in 
 computational biomolecular simulation methods such as Molecular Dynamics 
 simulations\, but scared to make the first step? What if you could start 
 smoothly using interactive\, graphical user interfaces like Jupyter 
 Notebooks? What if you could easily build pipelines chaining different 
 programs using a single\, interoperable library with a unique syntax?</p> 
 <p>Join the online training session where we will introduce the <a 
 href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0177-4">BioExcel building
  blocks</a>\, a fully interoperable software library comprising a 
 collection of Python wrappers on top of biomolecular simulation tools such
  as GROMACS\, Ambertools\, Openbabel or ACPYPE. The philosophy behind its 
 design\, following best practices and FAIR principles for software 
 development makes it easy to find\, install and use\, increasing 
 reproducibility and (re)usability. Demonstration workflows implemented in 
 Jupyter notebooks using the library will be presented and explained step 
 by step (e.g. protein-ligand complex GROMACS MD setup). The first steps on
  how to build and run complex workflows in command-line will be 
 explored.</p> <p><strong>Audience</strong></p> <p>This session is aimed at
  people interested in:</p> <ul> <li>Starting with computational 
 biomolecular simulations\, and more specifically Molecular Dynamics 
 simulations.</li> <li>Building computational biomolecular simulations 
 workflows\, ensuring reproducibility.</li> <li>No expertise in Molecular 
 Dynamics is needed to attend the training\, although some knowledge and 
 familiarity with this method is recommended to properly follow the course.
  Minimum Linux skills are also required.</li> <li>This is an interactive 
 session that is presented remotely using GoToTraining</li> </ul> 
 <p><strong>Learning outcomes</strong></p> <p>At the end of this session 
 you will be able to:</p> <ul> <li>Interactively work with computational 
 biomolecular simulation demonstration workflows built using the BioExcel 
 building blocks library in Jupyter Notebooks sessions: change input 
 structure\, modify parameters\, add/remove steps\, etc.</li> <li>Write a 
 new computational biomolecular simulation workflow using the BioExcel 
 building blocks library from scratch.</li> <li>Launch computational 
 biomolecular simulation workflows built using the BioExcel building blocks
  library in a command-line interface.</li> </ul>

SUMMARY:HPC and natural hazards: modelling tsunamis and volcanic plumes 
 using European flagship codes
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1482
DESCRIPTION:<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p> <p>This course focuses on 
 modelling two of the highest impact natural hazards\, volcanic eruptions 
 and tsunamis. The objective is to give a succinct theoretical overview and
  then introduce students on the use of different HPC flagship codes 
 included in the Center of Excellence for Exascale in Solid Earth (ChEESE).
  ASHEE is a volcanic plume and PDC simulator based on a multiphase fluid 
 dynamic model conceived for compressible mixtures composed of gaseous 
 components and solid particle phases. FALL3D is a Eulerian model for the 
 atmospheric transport and ground deposition of volcanic tephra (ash) used 
 in operational volcanic ash dispersal forecasts routinely used to prevent 
 aircraft encounters with volcanic ash clouds and to perform re-routings 
 avoiding contaminated airspace areas. T-HySEA solves the 2D shallow water 
 equations on hydrostatic and dispersive versions. Based on a high-order 
 Finite Volume (FV) discretisation (hydrostatic) with Finite Differences 
 (FD) for the dispersive version on two-way structured nested meshes in 
 spherical coordinates. Together with hands-on sessions\, the course will 
 also tackle post-process strategies based on python. In recent years\, the
  Python programming language has become one of the most popular choice for
  geoscientists. Python is a modern\, interpreted\, object-oriented\, open-
 source language easy to learn\, easy to read\, and fast to write. The 
 proliferation of multiple open-source projects with libraries available 
 every day\, have facilitated a rapid scientific development in the 
 geoscience community. In addition\, the modern data structures and object-
 oriented nature of the language along with an elegant syntax\, enable 
 Earth scientists to write more robust and less buggy code.</p> 
 <p><strong>Requirements</strong></p> <p>-At least University degree in 
 progress on Earth Sciences\, Computer Sciences or related area.<br> -Basic
  knowledge of LINUX<br> -Knowledge of C\, FORTRAN\, MPI or openMP is 
 recommended<br> -Knowledge of Earth Sciences data formats is recommended 
 (grib\, netcdf\, hdf\,...)<br> -Basic knowledge of python</p> 
 <p><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></p> <p>Participants will learn and 
 gain experience in installing SE codes and related utilities and 
 libraries\, running numerical simulations\, monitoring the execution of 
 supercomputing jobs\, analyzing and visualizing model results.</p>
