In many cases, reproducibility becomes one of the corner-stone measures (or even pre-requisite for publication) of the high quality research. In terms of HPC, reproducibility of benchmarks presumes exhaustive reports of the hardware and software setup, as well as an easy and consistent way to replicate the software environment in use.  \nUnfortunately, the users of HPC clusters and testbeds face with a number of obstacles on the way to prepare reproducible software environments. In particular, each data center provides its own subset of pre-installed software and has a set of specific policies and restrictions (like lack of access to internet). Moreover, in order to reach better performance, the end-user usually must install the software from sources watching all its dependencies, which demands an unnecessarily high level of technical expertise. As a results, installation often becomes a tedious time-consuming process discouraging people from taking care of software reproducibility particularly and from HPC generally.  \nSpack is a HPC-oriented package manager, which solves most of the above-mentioned problems if configured correctly, while Ansible addresses the issue of deploying and configuring Spack with off-line mirrors for the end-users.

Many important challenges in science such as protein folding, the search for the Higgs boson, drug discovery, and the development of nuclear fusion all depend on simulations, models and analyses run on HPC facilities to make progress.\n\nThis course introduces HPC to life science researchers, focusing on the aspects that are most important for those new to this technology to understand. It will help you judge how HPC can best benefit your research, and equip you to go on to successfully and efficiently make use of HPC facilities in future. The course will cover basic concepts in HPC hardware, software, user environments, filesystems, and programming models.
