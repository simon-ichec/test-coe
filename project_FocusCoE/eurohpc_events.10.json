In particular, recent advances in transport theory [1] will be presented in the form of lectures and hands-on sessions on hot topics in the field. The teachers will present novel methods used for materials research modelling.

In particular students will be taught how to perform efficient DFT+NEGF calculations, pre-processing, post-processing analysis and data visualization.\n\n_Electrochemistry_\n\nFirst principles simulations are now crucial in many areas of materials science. However, this has not yet reached the field of electrochemistry, where the complexity of the electrochemical environment and the presence of the external electrode potential are difficulties that have precluded direct application of the usual first-principles methods like DFT. We will explain how some of these problems, like the presence of the electrostatic potential, can be tackled using TranSIESTA.\n\n_Topological Insulators_\n\nTopological insulators (TI) are a phase of matter characterized by a bulk energy gap and conducting surface (or edge) states symmetry-protected against small perturbations. Quantum transport simulations are crucial to compute and validate the topological properties of materials. We will show how SIESTA can be used to predict the essential features of topological materials, leveraging on the recent Spin-Orbit Coupling implementation and SISL.\n\n_Inelastic transport_\n\nThe modelling of inelastic effects due to the electron-phonon coupling in nano-scale devices is of great technological importance as it impacts both the transport properties and Joule heating. It is especially challenging to include the effects in large-scale atomistic first principles device simulations. We will discuss how this can be addressed using various approximations and introduce the Inelastica package (https://github.com/tfrederiksen/inelastica/) based on TranSIESTA.\n\n_Correlated systems and the meanfield Hubbard model_\n\nCoulomb repulsion between electrons can lead to unpaired electron states and interesting spin structures. For graphene-like nanostructures the meanfield Hubbard model provides a simple and, yet, often sufficient method to understand how electronic interactions lead to magnetism. We will describe an implementation of this model based on SISL.\n\n_Single contacts by removal of periodic images_\n\nUnderstanding transport properties under non-equilibrium is of vital importance to the development of next-generation electronics. A basic principle of conducting such simulations is by using Bloch\u2019s theorem which has the disadvantage of adding a periodic image of the junction. We will present how users can overcome this limitation and simulate truly single junctions.\n\n_Modelling of extremely large-systems with DFT precision_\n\nRecent increase in compute power is rapidly decreasing the gap between experimental and theoretical works. This allows theoreticians to study one-to-one samples matching an exact experiment. However, there is still some way to go in terms of scalability and precision. Here we present a method to extract the important part of a Hamiltonian in an energy window allowing simulations of transport properties of even larger systems by retaining the band-structure without using any wannierization techniques.\n\n## References\n\n[1] N.

We will explain how some of these problems, like the presence of the electrostatic potential, can be tackled using TranSIESTA.\n\n_Topological Insulators_\n\nTopological insulators (TI) are a phase of matter characterized by a bulk energy gap and conducting surface (or edge) states symmetry-protected against small perturbations. Quantum transport simulations are crucial to compute and validate the topological properties of materials. We will show how SIESTA can be used to predict the essential features of topological materials, leveraging on the recent Spin-Orbit Coupling implementation and SISL.\n\n_Inelastic transport_\n\nThe modelling of inelastic effects due to the electron-phonon coupling in nano-scale devices is of great technological importance as it impacts both the transport properties and Joule heating. It is especially challenging to include the effects in large-scale atomistic first principles device simulations. We will discuss how this can be addressed using various approximations and introduce the Inelastica package (<https://github.com/tfrederiksen/inelastica/>) based on TranSIESTA.\n\n_Correlated systems and the meanfield Hubbard model_\n\nCoulomb repulsion between electrons can lead to unpaired electron states and interesting spin structures. For graphene-like nanostructures the meanfield Hubbard model provides a simple and, yet, often sufficient method to understand how electronic interactions lead to magnetism. We will describe an implementation of this model based on SISL.\n\n_Single contacts by removal of periodic images_\n\nUnderstanding transport properties under non-equilibrium is of vital importance to the development of next-generation electronics. A basic principle of conducting such simulations is by using Bloch\u2019s theorem which has the disadvantage of adding a periodic image of the junction. We will present how users can overcome this limitation and simulate truly single junctions.\n\n_Modelling of extremely large-systems with DFT precision_\n\nRecent increase in compute power is rapidly decreasing the gap between experimental and theoretical works. This allows theoreticians to study one-to-one samples matching an exact experiment. However, there is still some way to go in terms of scalability and precision. Here we present a method to extract the important part of a Hamiltonian in an energy window allowing simulations of transport properties of even larger systems by retaining the band-structure without using any wannierization techniques.\n\n## References\n\n[1] N.
