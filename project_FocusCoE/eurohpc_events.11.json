The tools will be presented on two different use cases but can be applied to any data.\n\nHiDALGO (https://hidalgo-project.eu/) \u2013 HPC and Big Data Technologies for Global Systems \u2013 is a European project funded by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union. The project is carried out by 13 institutions from seven countries.   \nThis training event will start with an introductory talk to provide a view of high-performance data analytics (HPDA) from the HiDALGO perspective. The main concepts will be presented, listing the tools that have been used, together with information about benchmarks the consortium has done (as a source of information about their scalability). This introduction also presents how these tools are being applied in HiDALGO, in order to solve different problems.  \nThe following part of the training will focus on HPC and HPDA technologies, applied to use-cases such as Urban Air Pollution (UAP). The UAP application is a software framework for modeling the vehicular traffic emitted air pollution and its dispersion at very high resolution by using geometry inputs (Open Street Map), coupled weather data (ECMWF) and traffic simulation (SUMO), computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools running on HPC infrastructures (OpenFOAM), and evaluation with HPDA methods.  \nThis HPC/HPDA/UAP-part of the training will introduce the UAP concept, workflows, implementations, application of the CFD-module in HPC environment, deployment to HPC, running, and evaluation. Participants will learn the techniques of these parts from a general perspective, namely, HPC workflow modeling (TOSCA in YAML rendering), basics of OpenFOAM for computation of air pollutant dispersion using HPC, and the applied HPDA methods for fast evaluation.  \nThe last part will provide an introduction to the data available at ECMWF and Copernicus, and the APIs for retrieving the data, followed by practical sessions on data exploration and manipulation. After this web-seminar, participants will be able to independently discover weather, climate, and environmental data produced and hosted by ECMWF, and also to retrieve and process these data using Python libraries.\n\n## For whom is the workshop\n\nResearchers, practitioners, and developers who are interested in implementation of HPC workflows and HPDA. Environmental scientists that would like to apply microscale models and exploit the strength of HPC easily.\n\nThe part provided by ECMWF is aimed in particular at researchers that would like to use weather, climate, or environmental data in their work.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n  * Participants are expected to have some basic knowledge about Big Data technologies (although not mandatory).\n  * Participants need to have basic knowledge of Linux CLI for the developer parts of the UAP training. For the application side, basic environmental knowledge related to air pollution needed (although not mandatory).\n  * For the part related to weather, participants are expected to have basic Python knowledge and be comfortable using Jupyter Notebooks. They will have the option to either use the mybinder.org platform or work locally. The github repository with the notebooks and a list of libraries will be provided before the workshop.\n\n\n\n## Instructors\n\n**Zolt\u00e1n Horv\u00e1th** , **\u00c1kos Kov\u00e1cs** , **L\u00e1szl\u00f3 K\u00f6rnyei** , **M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Constans** , Sz\u00e9chenyi Istv\u00e1n University, Gy\u0151r  \n**Milana Vuckovic** , European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts\n\n## Agenda\n\nFor the updated agenda and information on the sessions check the event's webpage at   \nhttps://enccs.se/events/2021/04/enccshidalgo-workshop-on-high-performance-data-analytics/", "eventAttendanceMode": "https://schema.org/OnlineEventAttendanceMode", "eventStatus": "https://schema.org/EventScheduled", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "representativeOfPage": "True", "url": "tmp_images/d139640c8a6fbc08272bb1d74f51d624.webp", "width": 720, "height": 360}, "doorTime": "2021-04-27T09:00:00+0200", "startDate": "2021-04-27T09:00:00+0200", "endDate": "2021-04-27T17:00:00+0200", "@id": "https://hpc-portal.eu/node/869", "isAccessibleForFree": "True", "location": {"@type": "VirtualLocation", "url": "https://events.prace-ri.eu/event/1193/", "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "59.3494563", "longitude": "18.0727612"}}, "language": ["English"], "sector": ["Research and Academia"], "country": ["Sweden"], "projects": ["PRACE", "HiDALGO"], "level": ["Beginner", "Intermediate", "Advanced"], "online": ["Live (synchronous)"], "url": "https://hpc-portal.eu/node/869", "html_description": "<h2>General description and learning outcomes</h2> <p>We would like to invite you to participate in our High-performance data analytics course where we will introduce different tools and methods for Big data handling.

To overcome the cost of a QM description on the one hand versus the limitations of a MM treatment on the other hand, methods have been developed that treat a small critical region of interest at QM level while retaining the computationally cheaper MM force field for the majority of the system.\n\nDespite the simplicity of the QM/MM concept, its application is currently restricted to a relatively small group of specialised expert users often using in-house codes. To unlock the power of QM/MM simulations for the wider biomolecular simulation community, the BioExcel Centre of Excellence has developed an interface between the molecular dynamics code GROMACS, which is widely used in the biomolecular simulation community, and the quantum chemistry package CP2K, which supports calculations under periodic boundary conditions with DFT methods.\n\nThis course explains key aspects relating to the use of QM/MM for biomolecular simulation with these two codes and equips participants with the ability to start using GROMACS and CP2K for this purpose in their own research. Participants are provided with the opportunity to gain hands-on practical experience running several example calculations on ARCHER2, the UK national supercomputing service.", "summary": "**Learning outcomes**  \nThis course will equip participants to perform hybrid QM/MM simulations using the molecular dynamics code..."}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "Event", "name": "Tsunami-HySEA training (Instituto de Hidr\u00e1ulica Ambiental de Cantabria)", "url": "https://cheese-coe.eu/events/tsunami-hysea-training-instituto-de-hidraulica-ambiental-de-cantabria", "description": "Carlos Sanchez and Jorge Macias, researchers from UMA, present a Tsunami-HySEA training course at the Instituto de Hidr\u00e1ulica Ambiental de Cantabria, Spain on 16 April 2021 and 7 May 2021.", "eventAttendanceMode": "https://schema.org/OfflineEventAttendanceMode", "eventStatus": "https://schema.org/EventScheduled", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "representativeOfPage": "True", "url": "images/FocusCoE_placeholder.webp", "width": 720, "height": 231}, "doorTime": "2021-04-16T09:00:00+0200", "startDate": "2021-04-16T09:00:00+0200", "endDate": "2021-05-07T17:00:00+0200", "@id": "https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1479", "isAccessibleForFree": "True", "location": {"@type": "VirtualLocation", "url": "https://cheese-coe.eu/events/tsunami-hysea-training-instituto-de-hidraulica-ambiental-de-cantabria", "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "43.452804200399", "longitude": "-3.8726006"}}, "language": ["Spanish"], "sector": ["Research and Academia", "Industry", "Public Sector"], "country": ["Spain"], "projects": ["ChEESE"], "level": ["Beginner", "Intermediate", "Advanced", "Other"], "html_description": "<p>Carlos Sanchez and Jorge Macias, researchers from UMA, present a Tsunami-HySEA training course at the Instituto de Hidr\u00e1ulica Ambiental de Cantabria, Spain on 16 April 2021 and 7 May 2021.</p>", "markdown_description": "Carlos Sanchez and Jorge Macias, researchers from UMA, present a Tsunami-HySEA training course at the Instituto de Hidr\u00e1ulica Ambiental de Cantabria, Spain on 16 April 2021 and 7 May 2021.", "summary": "Carlos Sanchez and Jorge Macias, researchers from UMA, present a Tsunami-HySEA training course at the Instituto de Hidr\u00e1ulica..."}]}]
