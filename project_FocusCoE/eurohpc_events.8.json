You will work on this for one week, in interaction with a small team of other participants.\n\nOn October 1, there is a final 3-hour online session where you will see what (some of) the other participants accomplished, and where you will get collective feedback as well as peer feedback on your work. \n\nIf you are interested to participate, you should register in two different steps (both steps are mandatory):\n\nStep 1: register at CECAM[ via this form](https://members.cecam.org/workshops/participate/6) (attention: if you don't have one yet,[ create a CECAM account first](https://members.cecam.org/register))\n\nStep 2: register[ via this form](https://forms.gle/6mTiigF7y1i1TMRh6).\n\nDeadline: September 8th, 2021\n\nStefaan Cottenier (Ghent University)\n\nAndrea Cucca (CNRS)\n\nRex Godby (University of York)\n\nMyrta Gr\u00fcning (Queen's University Belfast)\n\nGian-Marco Rignanese (Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain)\n\nFrancesco Sottile (Ecole Polytechnique)\n\nMatthieu Verstraete (University of Liege)\n\nZeila Zanolli (Utrecht University)", "summary": "In September 2021 we will hold a hands-on workshop on e-learning techniques and strategies, under the aegis of CECAM, Psi-k and the..."}]}]
