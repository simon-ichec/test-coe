In particular, recent advances in transport theory [1] will be presented in the form of lectures and hands-on sessions on hot topics in the field. The teachers will present novel methods used for materials research modelling. The participants will learn the advanced features of SIESTA [2], such as the calculations of non-equilibrium properties using the TranSIESTA/TBtrans approach and the python framework SISL [3]. For example, the school lectures will cover a recent scheme introducing truly single-junction transport calculations [4] and the new implementations to include in the transport calculations different corrections to the Hamiltonian accounting for electron-phonon coupling [5], spin orbit coupling and electronic correlation. Moreover, the users will learn how to extract a tight-binding Hamiltonian from a DFT Hamiltonian allowing them to deal with very large systems [6,7].\n\nThe lectures will take place via Zoom with an invited list of speakers who will present their work in a variety of fields in which the covered tools have been used. Each topic will be followed by a hands-on session allowing participants first-hand experience with the tools and analysis.\n\nWhile this is an open workshop (for everybody!), we ask participants to sign-up due to content distribution prior to the workshop itself.\n\nThe workshop will also host 2 evenings with online poster sessions, and all participants are expected to present their research in one of the two sessions.\n\n**The deadline for the abstract submission is April 1 th.**\n\nFor more details follow this link\n\nIn collaboration with \n\n**Provisional program**\n\nDay 1: Introduction to NEGF theory and hands-on with TBtrans, TranSiesta and SISL\n\nDay 2: DFT-TB parametrization and surrounding real space self-energies, evening poster session\n\nDay 3: Topological insulators and inelastic transport mechanisms, evening poster session\n\nDay 4: Electrochemistry and electron correlation in graphene nano structures\n\nDay 5: Solution to participant projects and _ad-hoc_ follow up questions\n\nUp to one month before the school, participants are invited to submit project suggestions (for the last day of the school) via this GitHub repository (please do so ASAP!) submit project suggestion here.\n\nWe invite everybody to join the online school (link will follow) and all material will be made available at https://github.com/zerothi/ts-tbt-sisl-tutorial\n\n**Detailed School Topics:**\n\n_Advanced usage of SIESTA, TranSIESTA/TBtrans and sisl_\n\nParticipants will learn how to use the advanced features implemented in the aforementioned code and python framework. In particular students will be taught how to perform efficient DFT+NEGF calculations, pre-processing, post-processing analysis and data visualization.\n\n_Electrochemistry_\n\nFirst principles simulations are now crucial in many areas of materials science. However, this has not yet reached the field of electrochemistry, where the complexity of the electrochemical environment and the presence of the external electrode potential are difficulties that have precluded direct application of the usual first-principles methods like DFT. We will explain how some of these problems, like the presence of the electrostatic potential, can be tackled using TranSIESTA.\n\n_Topological Insulators_\n\nTopological insulators (TI) are a phase of matter characterized by a bulk energy gap and conducting surface (or edge) states symmetry-protected against small perturbations. Quantum transport simulations are crucial to compute and validate the topological properties of materials. We will show how SIESTA can be used to predict the essential features of topological materials, leveraging on the recent Spin-Orbit Coupling implementation and SISL.\n\n_Inelastic transport_\n\nThe modelling of inelastic effects due to the electron-phonon coupling in nano-scale devices is of great technological importance as it impacts both the transport properties and Joule heating. It is especially challenging to include the effects in large-scale atomistic first principles device simulations. We will discuss how this can be addressed using various approximations and introduce the Inelastica package (https://github.com/tfrederiksen/inelastica/) based on TranSIESTA.\n\n_Correlated systems and the meanfield Hubbard model_\n\nCoulomb repulsion between electrons can lead to unpaired electron states and interesting spin structures. For graphene-like nanostructures the meanfield Hubbard model provides a simple and, yet, often sufficient method to understand how electronic interactions lead to magnetism. We will describe an implementation of this model based on SISL.\n\n_Single contacts by removal of periodic images_\n\nUnderstanding transport properties under non-equilibrium is of vital importance to the development of next-generation electronics. A basic principle of conducting such simulations is by using Bloch\u2019s theorem which has the disadvantage of adding a periodic image of the junction. We will present how users can overcome this limitation and simulate truly single junctions.\n\n_Modelling of extremely large-systems with DFT precision_\n\nRecent increase in compute power is rapidly decreasing the gap between experimental and theoretical works. This allows theoreticians to study one-to-one samples matching an exact experiment. However, there is still some way to go in terms of scalability and precision. Here we present a method to extract the important part of a Hamiltonian in an energy window allowing simulations of transport properties of even larger systems by retaining the band-structure without using any wannierization techniques.\n\n## References\n\n[1] N.

The tools will be presented on two different use cases but can be applied to any data.\n\nHiDALGO (https://hidalgo-project.eu/) \u2013 HPC and Big Data Technologies for Global Systems \u2013 is a European project funded by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union. The project is carried out by 13 institutions from seven countries.   \nThis training event will start with an introductory talk to provide a view of high-performance data analytics (HPDA) from the HiDALGO perspective. The main concepts will be presented, listing the tools that have been used, together with information about benchmarks the consortium has done (as a source of information about their scalability). This introduction also presents how these tools are being applied in HiDALGO, in order to solve different problems.  \nThe following part of the training will focus on HPC and HPDA technologies, applied to use-cases such as Urban Air Pollution (UAP). The UAP application is a software framework for modeling the vehicular traffic emitted air pollution and its dispersion at very high resolution by using geometry inputs (Open Street Map), coupled weather data (ECMWF) and traffic simulation (SUMO), computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools running on HPC infrastructures (OpenFOAM), and evaluation with HPDA methods.  \nThis HPC/HPDA/UAP-part of the training will introduce the UAP concept, workflows, implementations, application of the CFD-module in HPC environment, deployment to HPC, running, and evaluation. Participants will learn the techniques of these parts from a general perspective, namely, HPC workflow modeling (TOSCA in YAML rendering), basics of OpenFOAM for computation of air pollutant dispersion using HPC, and the applied HPDA methods for fast evaluation.  \nThe last part will provide an introduction to the data available at ECMWF and Copernicus, and the APIs for retrieving the data, followed by practical sessions on data exploration and manipulation. After this web-seminar, participants will be able to independently discover weather, climate, and environmental data produced and hosted by ECMWF, and also to retrieve and process these data using Python libraries.\n\n## For whom is the workshop\n\nResearchers, practitioners, and developers who are interested in implementation of HPC workflows and HPDA. Environmental scientists that would like to apply microscale models and exploit the strength of HPC easily.\n\nThe part provided by ECMWF is aimed in particular at researchers that would like to use weather, climate, or environmental data in their work.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n  * Participants are expected to have some basic knowledge about Big Data technologies (although not mandatory).\n  * Participants need to have basic knowledge of Linux CLI for the developer parts of the UAP training. For the application side, basic environmental knowledge related to air pollution needed (although not mandatory).\n  * For the part related to weather, participants are expected to have basic Python knowledge and be comfortable using Jupyter Notebooks. They will have the option to either use the mybinder.org platform or work locally. The github repository with the notebooks and a list of libraries will be provided before the workshop.\n\n\n\n## Instructors\n\n**Zolt\u00e1n Horv\u00e1th** , **\u00c1kos Kov\u00e1cs** , **L\u00e1szl\u00f3 K\u00f6rnyei** , **M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Constans** , Sz\u00e9chenyi Istv\u00e1n University, Gy\u0151r  \n**Milana Vuckovic** , European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts\n\n## Agenda\n\nFor the updated agenda and information on the sessions check the event's webpage at   \nhttps://enccs.se/events/2021/04/enccshidalgo-workshop-on-high-performance-data-analytics/", "eventAttendanceMode": "https://schema.org/OnlineEventAttendanceMode", "eventStatus": "https://schema.org/EventScheduled", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "representativeOfPage": "True", "url": "tmp_images/d139640c8a6fbc08272bb1d74f51d624.webp", "width": 720, "height": 360}, "doorTime": "2021-04-27T09:00:00+0200", "startDate": "2021-04-27T09:00:00+0200", "endDate": "2021-04-27T17:00:00+0200", "@id": "https://hpc-portal.eu/node/869", "isAccessibleForFree": "True", "location": {"@type": "VirtualLocation", "url": "https://events.prace-ri.eu/event/1193/", "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "59.3494563", "longitude": "18.0727612"}}, "language": ["English"], "sector": ["Research and Academia"], "country": ["Sweden"], "projects": ["PRACE", "HiDALGO"], "level": ["Beginner", "Intermediate", "Advanced"], "online": ["Live (synchronous)"], "url": "https://hpc-portal.eu/node/869", "html_description": "<h2>General description and learning outcomes</h2> <p>We would like to invite you to participate in our High-performance data analytics course where we will introduce different tools and methods for Big data handling.

In many cases, reproducibility becomes one of the corner-stone measures (or even pre-requisite for publication) of the high quality research. In terms of HPC, reproducibility of benchmarks presumes exhaustive reports of the hardware and software setup, as well as an easy and consistent way to replicate the software environment in use.  \nUnfortunately, the users of HPC clusters and testbeds face with a number of obstacles on the way to prepare reproducible software environments. In particular, each data center provides its own subset of pre-installed software and has a set of specific policies and restrictions (like lack of access to internet). Moreover, in order to reach better performance, the end-user usually must install the software from sources watching all its dependencies, which demands an unnecessarily high level of technical expertise. As a results, installation often becomes a tedious time-consuming process discouraging people from taking care of software reproducibility particularly and from HPC generally.  \nSpack is a HPC-oriented package manager, which solves most of the above-mentioned problems if configured correctly, while Ansible addresses the issue of deploying and configuring Spack with off-line mirrors for the end-users.
