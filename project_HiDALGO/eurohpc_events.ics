SUMMARY:Parallel Programming Workshop (MPI\, OpenMP and advanced topics) @ 
 HLRS
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/807
DESCRIPTION:<p><strong>Distributed memory parallelization with the Message 
 Passing Interface MPI (Mon\, for beginners):</strong></p> <p>On clusters 
 and distributed memory architectures\, parallel programming with the 
 Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the dominating programming model. The 
 course gives an introduction into MPI-1. Hands-on sessions (in C and 
 Fortran) will allow users to immediately test and understand the basic 
 constructs of the Message Passing Interface (MPI).</p> <p><strong>Shared 
 memory parallelization with OpenMP (Tue\, for beginners):</strong><br> The
  focus is on shared memory parallelization with OpenMP\, the key concept 
 on hyper-threading\, dual-core\, multi-core\, shared memory\, and ccNUMA 
 platforms. This course teaches shared memory OpenMP parallelization. 
 Hands-on sessions (in C and Fortran) will allow users to immediately test 
 and understand the directives and other interfaces of OpenMP. Race-
 condition debugging tools are also presented.</p> <p><strong>Intermediate 
 and advanced topics in parallel programming (Wed-Fri):</strong><br> Topics
  are advanced usage of communicators and virtual topologies\, one-sided 
 communication\, derived datatypes\, MPI-2 parallel file I/O\, hybrid mixed
  model MPI+OpenMP parallelization\, parallelization of explicit and 
 implicit solvers and of particle based applications\, parallel numerics 
 and libraries\, and parallelization with PETSc. MPI-3.0 introduced a new 
 shared memory programming interface\, which can be combined with MPI 
 message passing and remote memory access on the cluster interconnect. It 
 can be used for direct neighbor accesses similar to OpenMP or for direct 
 halo copies\, and enables new hybrid programming models. These models are 
 compared in the hybrid mixed model MPI+OpenMP parallelization session with
  various hybrid MPI+OpenMP approaches and pure MPI. Further aspects are 
 domain decomposition\, load balancing\, and debugging. Hands-on sessions

SUMMARY:Workshop on High-performance Data Analytics @ENCCS/HiDALGO
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/869
DESCRIPTION:<h2>General description and learning outcomes</h2> <p>We would 
 like to invite you to participate in our High-performance data analytics 
 course where we will introduce different tools and methods for Big data 
 handling. The tools will be presented on two different use cases but can 
 be applied to any data.</p> <p>HiDALGO (<a href="https://hidalgo-
 project.eu/">https://hidalgo-project.eu/</a>) – HPC and Big Data 
 Technologies for Global Systems – is a European project funded by the 
 Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union. The project is 
 carried out by 13 institutions from seven countries. <br>  This training 
 event will start with an introductory talk to provide a view of high-
 performance data analytics (HPDA) from the HiDALGO perspective. The main 
 concepts will be presented\, listing the tools that have been used\, 
 together with information about benchmarks the consortium has done (as a 
 source of information about their scalability). This introduction also 
 presents how these tools are being applied in HiDALGO\, in order to solve 
 different problems.<br>  The following part of the training will focus on 
 HPC and HPDA technologies\, applied to use-cases such as Urban Air 
 Pollution (UAP). The UAP application is a software framework for modeling 
 the vehicular traffic emitted air pollution and its dispersion at very 
 high resolution by using geometry inputs (Open Street Map)\, coupled 
 weather data (ECMWF) and traffic simulation (SUMO)\, computational fluid 
 dynamics (CFD) tools running on HPC infrastructures (OpenFOAM)\, and 
 evaluation with HPDA methods.<br>  This HPC/HPDA/UAP-part of the training 
 will introduce the UAP concept\, workflows\, implementations\, application
  of the CFD-module in HPC environment\, deployment to HPC\, running\, and 
 evaluation. Participants will learn the techniques of these parts from a 
 general perspective\, namely\, HPC workflow modeling (TOSCA in YAML 
 rendering)\, basics of OpenFOAM for computation of air pollutant 
 dispersion using HPC\, and the applied HPDA methods for fast 
 evaluation.<br>  The last part will provide an introduction to the data 
 available at ECMWF and Copernicus\, and the APIs for retrieving the data\,
  followed by practical sessions on data exploration and manipulation. 
 After this web-seminar\, participants will be able to independently 
 discover weather\, climate\, and environmental data produced and hosted by
  ECMWF\, and also to retrieve and process these data using Python 
 libraries.</p> <h2>For whom is the workshop</h2> <p>Researchers\, 
 practitioners\, and developers who are interested in implementation of HPC
  workflows and HPDA. Environmental scientists that would like to apply 
 microscale models and exploit the strength of HPC easily.</p> <p>The part 
 provided by ECMWF is aimed in particular at researchers that would like to
  use weather\, climate\, or environmental data in their work.</p> 
 <h2>Prerequisites</h2> <ul> <li>Participants are expected to have some 
 basic knowledge about Big Data technologies (although not mandatory).</li>
  <li>Participants need to have basic knowledge of Linux CLI for the 
 developer parts of the UAP training. For the application side\, basic 
 environmental knowledge related to air pollution needed (although not 
 mandatory).</li> <li>For the part related to weather\, participants are 
 expected to have basic Python knowledge and be comfortable using Jupyter 
 Notebooks. They will have the option to either use the mybinder.org 
 platform or work locally. The github repository with the notebooks and a 
 list of libraries will be provided before the workshop.</li> </ul>

SUMMARY:Reproducible Software Environments & Benchmarks with Ansible and 
 Spack: HiDALGO approach
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/868
DESCRIPTION:<p>A talk will be given by Sergiy Gogolenko at HLRS (HiDALGO 
 partner) on simplifying user software installation on versatile 
 clusters/testbeds\, as well as creating reproducible software environments
  and benchmarks with Spack and Ansible for HiDALGO and HLRS-SANE 
 teams.</p> <p>Abstract:<br>  In recent decades\, there is a tendency to 
 pay solid attention to reproducibility of experiments in science. In many 
 cases\, reproducibility becomes one of the corner-stone measures (or even 
 pre-requisite for publication) of the high quality research. In terms of 
 HPC\, reproducibility of benchmarks presumes exhaustive reports of the 
 hardware and software setup\, as well as an easy and consistent way to 
 replicate the software environment in use.<br>  Unfortunately\, the users 
 of HPC clusters and testbeds face with a number of obstacles on the way to
  prepare reproducible software environments. In particular\, each data 
 center provides its own subset of pre-installed software and has a set of 
 specific policies and restrictions (like lack of access to internet). 
 Moreover\, in order to reach better performance\, the end-user usually 
 must install the software from sources watching all its dependencies\, 
 which demands an unnecessarily high level of technical expertise. As a 
 results\, installation often becomes a tedious time-consuming process 
 discouraging people from taking care of software reproducibility 
 particularly and from HPC generally.<br>  Spack is a HPC-oriented package 
 manager\, which solves most of the above-mentioned problems if configured 
 correctly\, while Ansible addresses the issue of deploying and configuring
  Spack with off-line mirrors for the end-users. In addition\, Ansible and 
 Spack feature deep integration of YAML and JSON formats along with a high 
 extensibility via a wide range of builtin and external modules. It makes 
 these tools a perfect combination not only for automated fully-
 reproducible software installation\, but also for documenting hardware and
  software configurations along with the installation process uniformly in 
 a human readable format easy to post-process.<br>  The purpose of this 
 talk is largely to teach basics of configuring and using Spack for the 
 end-users of HPC systems\, as well as to introduce an Ansible+Spack 
 solution which we use for automated installation of the same software on a
  variety of clusters.<br>  Tentative agenda:<br>  - Introduction to Spack 
 and Ansible (5min)<br> - Spack from user prospective: basic usage 
 (10min)<br> - Configuring Spack (15 min)<br> - Deployment of Spack on 
 versatile hardware with Ansible (10min)<br> - Reproducible benchmarks and

SUMMARY:Tackling global challenges by use of HPC / HPDA and AI Workshop at 
 the HiPEAC Conference
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/974
DESCRIPTION:<p>Global challenges\, like the spread of diseases\, climate 
 change\, air pollution\, forced migration\, the spread of disinformation 
 in social networks and the sustainable use of energy are more emergent and
  urgent than ever. The use of HPC\, HPDA and Artificial Intelligence 
 allows to accurately model and simulate the underlying complex 
 processes.</p> <p>Within this workshop several current examples are 
 presented of how HPC\, HPDA and AI support the tackling of global 
 challenges. The workshop provides insights into advanced HPC\, HPDA and AI
  technologies to improve data-centric computation. It aims to attract and 
 bring together different stakeholders from the HPC and Big Data and Global
  Challenges communities.</p>
