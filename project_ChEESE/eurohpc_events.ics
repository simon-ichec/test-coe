SUMMARY:PATC: Tools and techniques to quickly improve performances of HPC 
 applications in Solid Earth
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1480
DESCRIPTION:<p>This is a course targeted to improve the overall performance
  of a code in Solid Earth\, currently in use at the CHEESE Center of 
 Excellence H2020 project. Parallel performance profiling tools will be 
 provided on the initial version of the code to find the so-called 
 performance bottlenecks. Starting from the profiling analysis\, it will 
 show how and where to intervene with respect to the hardware 
 characterization of the HPC machine used for the investigation.</p> <p>We 
 will show also how debug tools will be useful in the development / 
 optimization phase to eliminate any possible bugs introduced in the 
 writing (or redesign) of new parts of the code. Finally\, it will be shown
  how to improve the overall performance of the code with respect to other 
 popular parameters such as I / O\, vectorization\, etc.</p> <p> 
 <strong>Skills:</strong><br> At the end of the course the student will be 
 able to:</p> <p>Achieve the main information about performance of today 
 HPC computer</p> <p>Use a concrete methodology to improve the performance 
 of a code in Solid Earth already in use in the context of<br> ChEESE 
 project</p> <p>Find and solve the main bottlenecks of an application with 
 respect to appropriate computational metrics<br> and the machine used</p> 
 <p>Use appropriate debugging tools to eliminate any bugs that may arise 
 during the development / optimization phase</p> <p><strong>Target 
 audience: </strong></p> <p>Researchers in Solid Earth interested to learn 
 and use all those techniques and related tools that may allow them to 
 improve the performance of their code on current HPC architectures in the 
 shortest possible time.</p>

SUMMARY:Advanced Training on HPC for Computational Seismology
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1331
DESCRIPTION:<p>Are you interested in numerical wave simulations but feel 
 like there are too many codes and methods out there and don’t know which 
 option is right for you? Or\, perhaps you just want to refresh your 
 knowledge and gain some practical experience with the different 
 possibilities? Either way\, this fully virtual workshop is for you!</p> 
 <p>During three full days\, you will receive introductory hands-on 
 tutorials for <a href="https://exahype.eu/">ExaHyPE</a>\, <a 
 href="https://cos.ethz.ch/software/production/salvus.html">Salvus</a>\, <a
  href="http://www.seissol.org/">SeisSol</a>\, and <a 
 href="https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/specfem3d/">SPECFEM3D</a>\, 
 which are four different high-performance computational seismology 
 software packages focused on waveform modeling and inversion. The workshop

SUMMARY:HPC and natural hazards: modelling tsunamis and volcanic plumes 
 using European flagship codes
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1482
DESCRIPTION:<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p> <p>This course focuses on 
 modelling two of the highest impact natural hazards\, volcanic eruptions 
 and tsunamis. The objective is to give a succinct theoretical overview and
  then introduce students on the use of different HPC flagship codes 
 included in the Center of Excellence for Exascale in Solid Earth (ChEESE).
  ASHEE is a volcanic plume and PDC simulator based on a multiphase fluid 
 dynamic model conceived for compressible mixtures composed of gaseous 
 components and solid particle phases. FALL3D is a Eulerian model for the 
 atmospheric transport and ground deposition of volcanic tephra (ash) used 
 in operational volcanic ash dispersal forecasts routinely used to prevent 
 aircraft encounters with volcanic ash clouds and to perform re-routings 
 avoiding contaminated airspace areas. T-HySEA solves the 2D shallow water 
 equations on hydrostatic and dispersive versions. Based on a high-order 
 Finite Volume (FV) discretisation (hydrostatic) with Finite Differences 
 (FD) for the dispersive version on two-way structured nested meshes in 
 spherical coordinates. Together with hands-on sessions\, the course will 
 also tackle post-process strategies based on python. In recent years\, the
  Python programming language has become one of the most popular choice for
  geoscientists. Python is a modern\, interpreted\, object-oriented\, open-
 source language easy to learn\, easy to read\, and fast to write. The 
 proliferation of multiple open-source projects with libraries available 
 every day\, have facilitated a rapid scientific development in the 
 geoscience community. In addition\, the modern data structures and object-
 oriented nature of the language along with an elegant syntax\, enable 
 Earth scientists to write more robust and less buggy code.</p> 
 <p><strong>Requirements</strong></p> <p>-At least University degree in 
 progress on Earth Sciences\, Computer Sciences or related area.<br> -Basic
  knowledge of LINUX<br> -Knowledge of C\, FORTRAN\, MPI or openMP is 
 recommended<br> -Knowledge of Earth Sciences data formats is recommended 
 (grib\, netcdf\, hdf\,...)<br> -Basic knowledge of python</p> 
 <p><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></p> <p>Participants will learn and 
 gain experience in installing SE codes and related utilities and 
 libraries\, running numerical simulations\, monitoring the execution of 
 supercomputing jobs\, analyzing and visualizing model results.</p>
