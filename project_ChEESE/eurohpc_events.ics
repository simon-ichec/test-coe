SUMMARY:Advanced Training on HPC for Computational Seismology
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1331
DESCRIPTION:<p>Are you interested in numerical wave simulations but feel 
 like there are too many codes and methods out there and don’t know which 
 option is right for you? Or\, perhaps you just want to refresh your 
 knowledge and gain some practical experience with the different 
 possibilities? Either way\, this fully virtual workshop is for you!</p> 
 <p>During three full days\, you will receive introductory hands-on 
 tutorials for <a href="https://exahype.eu/">ExaHyPE</a>\, <a 
 href="https://cos.ethz.ch/software/production/salvus.html">Salvus</a>\, <a
  href="http://www.seissol.org/">SeisSol</a>\, and <a 
 href="https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/specfem3d/">SPECFEM3D</a>\, 
 which are four different high-performance computational seismology 
 software packages focused on waveform modeling and inversion. The workshop
  will provide you with an overview of their similarities\, differences\, 
 and areas of applicability. Unique and in-depth half-day practicals will 
 be provided for each package\, with computational resources provided by 
 HLRS. Participants will also be encouraged to present their own work 
 and/or motivation as a one-minute lightning-talk during the wrap-up 
 session of the workshop. This training event is hosted by <a 
 href="https://cheese-coe.eu/">ChEESE</a>\, the Center of Excellence for 
 Exascale in Solid Earth and supported by the <a href="https://enerxico-
 project.eu/">ENERXICO</a> project.</p>
