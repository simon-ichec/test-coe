SUMMARY:GROMACS Workshop
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/827
DESCRIPTION:<p>Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations are fundamental to 
 understand the mechanism of biological systems. This workshop aims to 
 provide an introduction on the use and on the features of a well-
 established and highly used package in the field GROMACS.</p> <p>The 
 workshop covers an introduction to MD simulation\, to accelerated weight 
 histogram methods and to GraphicsGraphical Processing Units (GPU) 
 performance. At the end the participants will be familiar with the 
 features of GROMACS code\, and they will be able to set up and perform 
 molecular simulation on the covered topic.</p>
